        </figure><p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-happens-to-donald-trump-now-that-hes-been-convicted.html">Donald Trump</a> is now <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">a convicted felon</a>, but what impact that has on the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-trump-will-campaign-as-a-convicted-felon.html">2024 presidential race</a> remains to be seen. The first indicators of how voters may respond will be the results of polls taken after <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-it-was-like-in-court-the-moment-trump-was-convicted.html">a New York jury found Trump guilty</a> on <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-was-convicted-but-prosecutors-contorted-the-law.html">34 counts of falsifying business records</a>. Here’s what those polls say so far (and this post will be updated as more poll results come out).</p><div>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>ABC News/Ipsos poll finds mostly even split in opinion of verdict/trial, except among “double-haters”</strong></p><p>Per <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/plurality-americans-trumps-guilty-verdict-correct-hush-money/story?id=110744698">ABC News’ summary of the new poll</a>, which was conducted May 31-June 1 among a random national sample of 781 adults:</p><blockquote><p>A plurality of Americans, 50%, think [Trump’s guilty verdict] was correct, a new ABC News/<a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/trump-guilty-verdict-makes-minimal-impact-public-opinion">Ipsos</a> poll finds, and almost as many, 49%, think he should end his 2024 presidential campaign over the result. …</p><p><br /></p><p>Forty-seven percent of Americans said they think the charges against Trump in this case were politically motivated, while 38% say they were not. At the same time, the slight majority at 51%, think Trump intentionally did something illegal in this case. Twelve percent think Trump did something wrong but not intentionally, and 19% believe he did not do anything wrong.</p><p><br /></p><p>The proportion of Americans who say Trump should end his presidential campaign as a result of this verdict is 49%, which is similar to findings from an April 2023 ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted shortly after the Manhattan grand jury handed down the indictment against him in this case. In the April 2023 polls, 48% thought he should suspend his campaign because of the indictment.</p></blockquote><p>And here’s what independents and “double-haters” said:</p><blockquote><p>A majority of Independents think Trump’s verdict was correct, 52%, and the same amount believe that he should end his candidacy. For double-haters, those reactions are even more pronounced – 65% of Americans who view both Trump and Biden unfavorably think the verdict this week was correct, with 67% believing Trump should end his presidential campaign. Forty-five percent of Independents and 51% of double-haters think the hush-money trial was politically motivated, compared to 83% of Republicans and 20% of Democrats.</p></blockquote>
    </div><div>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>A Morning Consult poll finds majority approval of the verdict</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/analysis/donald-trump-polling-guilty-verdict-jury-trial">Morning Consult survey</a> on Friday found that 54 percent of voters approved (“strongly” or “somewhat”) of the verdict and that Trump committed a crime. In addition, 15 percent of Republican voters, 8 percent of Trump supporters, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/01/poll-trump-conviction-election-independent-voters">49 percent of independents</a> thought he should end his presidential bid.</p><p>Regarding the possible sentences for Trump, a solid majority of survey respondents — 69 percent — thought Trump should be fined as punishment. Another 49 percent thought probation would be best. About half opposed sentencing Trump to prison time, and 44 percent thought he should go to jail.</p>
    </div><div>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicates some Republicans and independents are less likely to vote for Trump</strong></p><p>A two-day national <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/one-10-republicans-less-likely-vote-trump-after-guilty-verdict-reutersipsos-poll-2024-05-31/">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a>, conducted online after Trump’s guilty verdict, found that one in ten registered Republican voters were less likely to vote for Trump following his conviction, and one in four independent voters were less likely to support him as well.</p><p>However, NBC News senior political director Mark Murray <a href="https://x.com/mmurraypolitics/status/1796970044473151813">cautions</a> against over-interpreting that:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3. Be careful about emphasizing the 1-in-10 GOP voters who say they are *less likely* to vote for Trump after his conviction, per Ipsos. <br><br>That finding is identical to what NPR/PBS/Marist found of GOP voters before the conviction -- with most saying it doesn&#39;t make difference</p>&mdash; Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) <a href="https://twitter.com/mmurraypolitics/status/1796970044473151813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Of the 2,556 adults who responded to the poll, 41 percent said they would vote for Biden, and 38 percent said they would vote for Trump — which is a difference within the poll’s margin of error.</p><p>Of registered Republicans, 35 percent said Trump’s guilty verdict made it more likely they’d vote for him. 18 percent of independents said the same. And 56 percent of registered Republicans said the verdict would have no effect on their vote, as did the same percentage of independents.</p><p>Regarding other views of the verdict, 53 percent of respondents said they didn’t think Trump should be jailed, while 46 percent said he should. A slim majority also thought the hush-money case against Trump wasn’t politically motivated, while 46 percent said it was — in order to keep Trump from becoming president again.</p><p>A larger majority, 60 percent, said it was important that the three pending trials Trump faces should be completed before the election — which is at this point extremely unlikely.</p>

        </figure><p>Everyone involved in political analysis has pretty much assumed that no matter who wins the 2024 presidential (and for that matter, congressional) elections, it will be close. The reasons are obvious: with the arguable exception of 2008, when the size of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/11/what-obama-is-doing-behind-the-scenes-to-help-democrats-win.html">Barack Obama</a>’s victory over <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/an-abbreviated-history-of-trumps-feud-with-john-mccain.html">John McCain</a> was almost certainly enhanced by the proximity of Election Day to a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2008/09/hollywood_screwed.html?origSession=D230828vNRtpneMKWZ0k2ar8jvxYZmxK6Z71p3Jb%2BlRXGuCdFU%3D&_gl=1*1b1warw*_ga*MTUwNzkzODk1Ni4xNzE1NjE3NTYz*_ga_DNE38RK1HX*MTcxNzE3NTI1Ny4xMDQuMS4xNzE3MTc2MjcyLjAuMC41ODM3MDc2MTY.*_fplc*YWxlcUxiOUx3SmJPVWpQTlJMMCUyRiUyQk9xTHMyYWVzaVVrUEJGNk1YVHZHSUU1czdBU3ZLdWRDN2pibUw1Y3g2azRIOG1xVlIyemVRS20yaElRJTJCMThlQUUlMkJIeGRzWUptdTEzazR5amZxdUpIUCUyRkluMXFPUlBIVXJ6dEhjR0tuZyUzRCUzRA..#_ga=2.161034740.819821118.1715617563-1507938956.1715617563">collapse of the financial system</a>, every presidential contest since 1996 has been extremely competitive. That includes a surprisingly close outcome in 2020 featuring the same two candidates who will meet this year. More generally, the two major parties appear to be in steady equipoise when it comes to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/the-partisanship-and-ideology-of-american-voters/">partisan affiliation</a>. And while there’s aways a fierce ongoing battle over swing voters, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/04/11/true-swing-voters-are-extraordinarily-rare-in-america">size of that portion of the electorate remains smaller</a> than it was in much of the last century.</p><p>Current indicators also show a close contest between <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-needs-disengaged-unhappy-voters-to-stay-home.html">Joe Biden</a> and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-happens-to-donald-trump-now-that-hes-been-convicted.html">Donald Trump</a>. For all the interminable <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-vs-trump-polls-age.html">Democratic panic</a> over Biden’s standing in the polls, Trump’s lead in the national <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden">RealClearPolitics polling averages</a> is under one percent, and has only breached four percent once (very briefly) in the entire cycle. As close as 2016 and 2020 turned out to be, there were ebbs in flows in the polling those years that were a lot more dramatic than anything we’re seeing lately.</p><p>So you’d be tempted right now to treat the presidential contest much like an NBA game wherein it’s usually safe to ignore the score until the very end. But as a thought experiment, it’s worth imagining scenarios that could blow open this tense election year in one direction or the other, and what might produce them.</p><p>By “disasters” I don’t mean truly catastrophic events like the death or disability of Biden or Trump, a shooting war involving U.S. troops, another financial crash, or a new pandemic. The <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">criminal conviction of Donald Trump</a> and the wildly uncertain fallout from it, though, is a reminder that it’s wise to expect the unexpected.</p><p><strong>Recipes for Democratic Disaster</strong></p><p><strong>Nobody cares about Trump’s conviction other than his angry base</strong></p><p>It’s pretty clear the Biden campaign has counted on closing the small but consistent gap with Trump by getting some help from fresh publicity over his past and recent misconduct. The moment for that to happen has arrived with the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-it-was-like-in-court-the-moment-trump-was-convicted.html">45th president’s conviction on 34 criminal counts</a>. Indeed, since this is the only Trump criminal case that will probably come to trial before Election Day, it could be now or never for a political accountability moment benefiting the incumbent.</p><p>So what if it comes and goes without any game-changing effect on Trump’s appeal? <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/trumps-guilty-verdict-impact-2024-presidential-election/story?id=110650906">Anticipatory polling</a> has shown that the impact on swing voters might not be profound, and we have an important precedent: the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/watch-the-access-hollywood-clip-on-trump-bush.html?origSession=D230828vNRtpneMKWZ0k2ar8jvxYZmxK6Z71p3Jb%2BlRXGuCdFU%3D&_gl=1*1owktov*_ga*MTUwNzkzODk1Ni4xNzE1NjE3NTYz*_ga_DNE38RK1HX*MTcxNzE3NTI1Ny4xMDQuMS4xNzE3MTgwODE3LjAuMC41ODM3MDc2MTY.*_fplc*YWxlcUxiOUx3SmJPVWpQTlJMMCUyRiUyQk9xTHMyYWVzaVVrUEJGNk1YVHZHSUU1czdBU3ZLdWRDN2pibUw1Y3g2azRIOG1xVlIyemVRS20yaElRJTJCMThlQUUlMkJIeGRzWUptdTEzazR5amZxdUpIUCUyRkluMXFPUlBIVXJ6dEhjR0tuZyUzRCUzRA..#_ga=2.68597592.819821118.1715617563-1507938956.1715617563"><em>Access Hollywood</em> tapes</a> of October 2016, which initially looked like a late-campaign knockout punch for the Republican nominee. GOP elites, including even Trump’s running-mate <a href="https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/politics/mike-pence-and-the-tale-of-the-tape/">Mike Pence</a>, went <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-access-hollywood-tape-prompted-202037186.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL0NUP9viYWi7aze4h1VW9TOZS1NgTPYBrxigVE8FCjmWohRQYS3tUn-WRQ90qBVmGallQC9ITRVhbo9Ocy4v4KjC4ax-jzKnYjYifAqjkgTKLrfjEQKiepVQlwE-cjg22Wasf8s17Uzcngd3B3nrIMMF5tmRvjQPypxSpNBro8J">into a panic</a> … but then voters seemed to yawn. Hillary Clinton got a quick polling spike in the week after the tapes came out, but it soon subsided (helped, as it happens, by the release of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/">Comey Letter</a> suggesting renewed law enforcement interest in Clinton’s email accounts). Subsequent talk about “Teflon Don” was exaggerated, but there does seem to be something about the former president that insulates him from the kind of reputational damage that would take down other politicians.</p><p>The one thing we already know for sure is that Trump’s criminal conviction is producing an <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/does-the-conservative-rage-machine-go-to-11.html">intense backlash</a> from MAGA activists and Republican pols generally, along with a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/31/trump-fundraising-record-hush-money-conviction">major boost in GOP fund-raising</a>, which that party really needed. If swing-voter reaction is meh, the net effect of Trump becoming a convicted criminal could be positive for him, which would be <em>very</em> negative for Team Biden. The Democratic campaign’s no-doubt-vast plans to go negative on Trump’s misconduct may need to be reconsidered as November approaches, and that, too, would be a bad sign for Biden.</p><p><strong>Negative perceptions of the economy and the border don’t change</strong></p><p>It’s gospel among political scientists that some basic voter perceptions become fixed well before Election Day, and we may be approaching that point with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/05/23/views-of-the-nations-economy-may-2024/">very negative perceptions of the U.S. economy</a> (and the toxic sub-topic of living costs) and of <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/issues">conditions on the southern border</a>. If so, it’s unlikely that Biden’s chronically subpar job approval ratings (hovering just above or just below 40 percent <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/issues">for the last eight months</a>) are going to significantly improve. Here, per <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/311825/presidential-job-approval-related-reelection-historically.aspx">Gallup</a>, were the job approval ratings of every postwar president in June before they faced voters in a reelection bid: 40 (Truman), 72 (Eisenhower), 74 (Johnson), 59 (Nixon), 45 (Ford), 32 (Carter), 54 (Reagan), 37 (G.H.W. Bush), 55 (Clinton), 49 (G.W. Bush), 46 (Obama), and 41 (Trump). With the sole exception of Truman, whose reelection is regarded as the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/01/can-joe-biden-pull-off-a-harry-truman-against-donald-trump.html">greatest political upset in U.S. history</a>, any president in Biden’s territory has lost.</p><p>Yes, Trump is a different kind of opponent who makes it easier for an unpopular incumbent to avoid a straight referendum, but it’s tough to win a second term if voters think you’ve performed poorly on such <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/is-the-drop-in-border-crossings-too-late-to-help-biden.html">highly salient issues</a>.</p><p><strong>Abortion rights or other issues don’t pan out for Biden</strong></p><p>Other than Trump’s criminality, the factor Team Biden has counted on most is the emergence of issues that help rather than hurt the incumbent, first among them <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/2024-election-abortion-nevada-arizona-jb-pritzker.html">abortion</a>. That’s still an assumption that’s a bit shaky. It’s now been nearly two years since the Supreme Court that Donald Trump <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/05/the-anti-abortion-movements-love-for-trump-makes-sense.html">shaped in order to reverse <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a> redeemed his promises to the anti-abortion movement–and he’s still leading in the polls. Yes, his efforts to take the issue off the table in the presidential election by <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-triangulation-abortion.html">embracing a states rights position</a> are deeply cynical and not to be trusted. But they might work, or at least mitigate the damage that unpopular Republican positions on abortion might otherwise wrought. At this point it’s hard to see Biden winning states like Arizona and Nevada without a big collateral impact from <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-abortion-rights-may-face-new-setbacks-in-november.html">abortion rights ballot measures</a> voters in those states are likely to encounter, but no one really knows if the spillover will happen in such an atmosphere of partisan polarization.</p><p>If abortion fails to serve as a silver bullet for Democrats, other issues could turn sour for Biden. If conditions in Ukraine get worse, it’s not clear the Biden administration will be able to do anything about it. And if the war in Gaza drags on and continues to represent a humanitarian disaster, that’s all bad for Biden.</p><p><strong>There’s an adverse realignment of key Democratic voting groups</strong></p><p>Speaking of Gaza … there are much-discussed subcurrents in the polls this year that may simply represent a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-tackling-black-latino-voter-problem-trump-rcna154229">temporary estrangement of pro-Democratic voting groups</a> unhappy with Biden’s handling of the economy, the border, or Gaza. The president’s team hopes that they may at least partially return to the Democratic column once the alternative fully sinks in.</p><p>But there is another possibility that could represent really bad news for Democrats, not just this year but for the foreseeable future: an actual <em>realignment</em> of estranged groups, including the long-feared loss of the overwhelming Democratic advantage among <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/609776/democrats-lose-ground-black-hispanic-adults.aspx">Black and (to a lesser extent) Latino voters</a>. If, after all, a chronic race-baiter like Trump is performing better among nonwhite voters than anyone since George W. Bush or even Richard Nixon, there may be a problem bigger than anything Joe Biden is doing wrong.</p><p><strong>What is the worst possible outcome for Democrats?</strong></p><p>Aside from losing the White House if Trump defeats Biden, there’s a very significant risk Democrats would emerge from this election on the losing end of a trifecta. The contest for control of the House is pretty much a tossup that could keep the chamber Republican if the presidential race goes south. And thanks to a strongly pro-Republican landscape, the odds are <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/senate-democrats-have-no-margin-for-error-in-november.html">quite high that the Senate will flip</a> no matter what happens to Biden and Trump. A GOP trifecta would give the incoming Trump administration the use of budget reconciliation tools to get its agenda past any potential Democratic Senate filibuster, while giving Team Trump rubber-stamped executive and judicial appointments that it is likely to use and abuse.</p><p><strong>Recipes for Republican Disaster</strong></p><p><strong>Trump’s criminal conviction represents a tipping point where non-MAGA swing voters abandon him</strong></p><p>The unprecedented nature of the jury verdict in Manhattan means that “Teflon Don’s” imperviousness to scandal may not continue. Biden is counting on making the election comparative rather than a referendum, and nothing may quite crystalize his efforts to focus attention on his opponent than the sobriquet of “Donald Trump, convicted criminal.”</p><p>Yes, Trump has worked hard to convince his Republican base that all the prosecutions he is facing represent a partisan weaponization of the judicial system rather than any sort of normal operation of law enforcement to bring down a bad guy. But it’s not so clear that this framing of the situation will be convincing to swing voters, particularly the normally Democratic and relatively disengaged voters on which Trump has built his fragile lead over Biden, as the New York <em>Times</em>’ Nate Cohn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/upshot/polling-trump-verdict-conviction.html?partner=slack&smid=sl-share">explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In [a recent] Times/Siena poll, 21 percent of Mr. Trump’s young supporters said they’d back Mr. Biden if there were a conviction. In comparison, only 2 percent of 65-and-older Trump supporters said the same. Similarly, 27 percent of Black voters who backed Mr. Trump flipped to Mr. Biden, compared with just 5 percent of white respondents.</p></blockquote><p>If it sticks that’s the sort of trend that could wipe out Trump’s lead in the polls for good.</p><p><strong>Biden voters become likelier voters</strong></p><p>Even as Trump has led in a majority of polls, there have been signs that the categories of voters most likely to turn out, notably college-educated voters, are leaning towards Biden, continuing an <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-needs-disengaged-unhappy-voters-to-stay-home.html">inversion of past turnout patterns</a>. As we get closer to November and pollsters begin to screen respondents for likelihood to vote, Biden could pull into a steady lead. Again, Trump’s criminal status might well solidify the disdain of some traditional Republican voters who are very likely to show up at the polls and rise up against the MAGA-fication of their party. If Biden can dispel perceptions he’s feeble or even senile during the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-biden-debate-agreement.html">candidate debates he has eagerly proposed</a>, he could well re-build his winning coalition of 2020.</p><p><strong>Trump loses anti-incumbent votes to Kennedy</strong></p><p>Another possible byproduct of Trump’s criminal conviction and the pounding he is sure to take from a well-financed Biden campaign is a bleeding of support to independent candidate <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/kennedy-fights-for-game-changing-spot-on-the-debate-stage.html">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, who is also very much running a campaign against the status quo in all its forms and may have a special appeal to conservative voters still enraged by COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccine mandates. Even if Kennedy fades down the stretch as indie candidates typically do, some of his supporters could stay home rather than going with either of the tainted major-party candidates.</p><p><strong>Trump squanders his issue advantages by devoting his campaign to rage and revenge</strong></p><p>Still another possible by-product of the Trump trial fallout is that his campaign’s focus on vengeance for his alleged victimization in 2020 and in 2024 will begin to obscure the issue advantages he has developed over the unpopular incumbent. This factor could be aggravated if the Trump campaign becomes so focused on mobilizing its base that it forgets the margin of victory will come (if it comes at all) from voters upset about the economy, the border, crime or Gaza. In particular, Trump’s regular threats of another challenge to the outcome could begin to offend Americans who badly want to consign politics to a smaller part of daily life.</p><p>It’s also possible that some of Trump’s issue advantages will fade in any event as conditions improve. How long can swing voters fail to notice stable prices, very low unemployment, falling violent crime rates and reduced border crossings? And can Trump entirely escape his party’s unpopular positions on taxes on the wealthiest Americans and businesses, on Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare, and most of all on abortion? From the moment his Supreme Court appointees helped overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, pro-choice forces have compiled an <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/11/election-results-abortion-rights-winning-streak-continues.html">unbroken winning streak</a> on ballot measures. They could help Biden and other Democrats win in Arizona, Nevada and perhaps even Florida.</p><p><strong>What is the worst possible outcome for Republicans?</strong></p><p>Any presidential defeat, particularly if it’s sizable enough to discourage post-election challenges of the results, would leave the GOP at sea. A Biden popular vote win would mean that Republicans have been on the short end of the national popular vote in eight of the last nine presidential elections; that’s quite a losing streak. A second Trump loss, moreover, would kill the much-discussed idea that the 45th president has somehow figured out a way for his party to build its own winning post-Reagan coalition that extends beyond angry white reactionary voters.</p><p>A Trump loss would very likely mean a Republican loss of the House as well. And it’s even possible that in a good presidential year for Democrats, they could overcome a terrible Senate landscape and win their own trifecta in Washington, with all the benefits that would provide. Above all, there’s no question the GOP would have to undertake a dark night of the soul over its Trump-less future and the ideological direction of the party he has come to dominate.</p><div><p>More on Politics</p><ul><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-the-polls-are-saying-after-trumps-conviction.html">What the Polls Are Saying After Trump’s Conviction</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/alvin-bragg-wasnt-just-right-he-delivered-against-trump.html">The Courage of Alvin Bragg’s Conviction</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Trump’s Guilty Verdict: As It Happened</a></li></ul></div>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p>In the end, it was Manhattan’s plodding and plainspoken district attorney, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/dont-underestimate-alvin-braggs-case-against-trump.html">Alvin Bragg</a>, who proved the pundits wrong and delivered what all the big-talking power brokers could not: the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">criminal conviction</a> of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-it-was-like-in-court-the-moment-trump-was-convicted.html">ex-president Donald Trump</a> for the corrupt and illegal business practices that helped him win the 2016 race for president.</p><p>Bragg does not swagger into a room the way so many New York lawyers and politicians do. He does not preen, pose, shout, or boast. Even when traveling with an armed security detail, he tends to arrive quietly, with the friendly, open and approachable style of <a href="https://sojo.net/articles/harlem-sunday-school-teacher-who-led-trump-s-indictment">a Sunday school teacher</a>, which Bragg has been for years.</p><p>It is typical for New York’s men of power to huddle in dark bars and boozy back rooms, swapping gossip, cutting deals, and sipping booze. You’re more likely to find Bragg in Harlem’s Abyssinian Baptist Church chatting about values, scripture, and how to make one’s way in the world with honesty and integrity. That, alone, makes him a different kind of fish in the shark tank of New York politics, which is stocked with bullies, boasters, bluster, and bullshit.</p><p>“This type of white collar prosecution is core to what we do at the Manhattan District Attorney’s office,” <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Bragg said after the conviction</a>, repeating almost word for word what he’d said <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/dont-underestimate-alvin-braggs-case-against-trump.html">last April</a> after Trump’s indictment and arrest. He was telling the truth: An investigation by NBC News showed that during Bragg’s first 15 months as DA, the office charged 166 felony counts for falsifying business records against 34 different people or corporations. As Bragg put it: “While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial, and ultimately today at this verdict, in the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors — by following the facts and the law, and doing so without fear or favor.”</p><p>Fear and favor have been floating around <em>People </em>v.<em> Trump</em> from the start. The defendant himself, a former president of the United States who instigated the January 6 riot at the Capitol, publicly predicted that “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/trump-threatens-death-and-destruction-if-hes-arrested.html">death and destruction</a>” would be the result of his being tried on criminal charges by Bragg. That didn’t happen, even when Trump posted the word “PROTEST” on social media and only a handful of people turned out. But Bragg did receive at least <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/03/31/manhattan-da-alvin-bragg-inundated-with-racist-emails-death-threats-amid-trump-indictment-we-are-everywhere-and-we-have-guns/">89 death threats</a>, including a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alvin-bragg-threatened-hours-after-trump-warns-death-destruction-1790254">note</a> that said “Alvin — I’ll kill you,” included with a package containing a suspicious white powder. Another ominous note read: “Remember we are everywhere and we have guns.”</p><p>In addition to dodging pro-Trump death threats, Bragg had to fend off attacks from men like Carey Dunne and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/02/mark-pomerantzs-revealing-fight-with-alvin-bragg-over-trump.html">Mark Pomerantz</a>, two seasoned prosecutors brought in as special assistant district attorneys by Bragg’s predecessor, Cy Vance. Dunne and Pomerantz quit the D.A.’s office when, shortly after taking office, Bragg refused to bring sweeping racketeering charges against the Trump Organization.</p><p>“I believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now, and on the existing record, is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest. I therefore cannot continue in my current position,” Pomerantz wrote in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/nyregion/mark-pomerantz-resignation-letter.html">resignation letter</a>. “I have worked too hard as a lawyer, and for too long, now to become a passive participant in what I believe to be a grave failure of justice.” Pomerantz went on to write a self-aggrandizing book attacking Bragg and disparaging the case against Trump as “the legal equivalent of a plane crash” due to “pilot error.”</p><p>In legal terms, many attorneys, including my friend <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-was-convicted-but-prosecutors-contorted-the-law.html?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Intelligencer%20-%20May%2031%2C%202024&utm_term=Subscription%20List%20-%20Daily%20Intelligencer%20%281%20Year%29">Elie Honig</a>, were bothered by Bragg’s use of New York’s clunky two-step law that makes it a felony to file false business records. Trump has been convicted of using false records — disguising his hush-money payments as a “legal fee” paid to his fixer/lawyer Michael Cohen — with the intent of concealing or advancing additional crimes. The quirk under New York law is that those additional crimes do not need to be proved or even specified. We don’t know whether the jurors believed Trump intended to violate campaign finance laws, tax laws, or some other statute.</p><p>The legal objections were accompanied by complaints from the pundit class that condemned Bragg for bringing a case that they called trivial or a distraction; the critics included <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/donald-trump-new-york-indictment-bragg-should-not-be-brought.html">Jonathan Chait</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-wrong-indictment-against-trump-stormy-daniels-alvin-bragg-court-reagan-carter-iran-jan-6-33bdf2ef">Peggy Noonan</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/04/donald-trump-charged-felony-bragg-mistake.html">Richard Hasen</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/media/3910806-van-jones-says-bragg-may-step-back-from-the-brink-on-charging-trump/">Van Jones</a>. The main complaint seemed to be that falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments to a porn star was small potatoes compared to sweeping charges of election fraud in Georgia or the mishandling of top secret documents in Florida.</p><p>“The players in the drama aren’t people of import who stand for big things, they’re not fate-of-the-republic people, they don’t have any size. They’re tacky lowlifes doing tacky lowlife things,” Noonan wrote in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-wrong-indictment-against-trump-stormy-daniels-alvin-bragg-court-reagan-carter-iran-jan-6-33bdf2ef"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>. “The case involves a questionable legal theory that depends on the testimony of Michael Cohen, who is half-mad in his own right.”</p><p>Fair enough. But Ron Kuby, a well-known left-leaning attorney, pointed out in the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/01/29/here-comes-trumps-nyc-criminal-case/"><em>Daily News</em></a> that the tackiness of the witnesses and the complexity of the law do not constitute a valid defense. “It is true that the application of these laws has never been used to criminalize attempted campaign finance violations, but that is because most candidates for president keep better books,” Kuby wrote earlier this year. “It is no more novel than arresting a presidential candidate for DWI; it has never happened before but the law is unambiguous.”</p><p>That sounds about right to me: if Trump or any other candidate was charged with driving while intoxicated, few people would say the matter should be ignored. Bragg, operating at the steady, methodical pace of the courts, stood up for the principle that using business records to hide additional crimes should not be ignored or dismissed for Trump or anybody else. And he convinced a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the former president violated the law.</p><p>Bragg now gets the last laugh against his critics in the legal profession. Pomerantz got a book contract and made money; Bragg got a conviction and made history. And politically, he has made more of the dent in Trump’s attempted comeback than any of the louder, flashier Democrats that frequent the cable news shows, liberal think tanks, and the big-donor speaking circuit. It almost reads like the kind of lesson from scripture that gets taught in Sunday school: that sometimes, the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong</p><div><p>More on the trial and verdict</p><ul><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Trump Will Appeal: Live Updates</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-happens-to-donald-trump-now-that-hes-been-convicted.html">What Happens to Trump Now?</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-it-was-like-in-court-the-moment-trump-was-convicted.html">What It Was Like in Court the Moment Trump Was Convicted</a></li></ul></div>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p>At this point, we should all realize that <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/09/master-dealmaker-melania-keeps-renegotiating-her-prenup.html">Melania Trump</a> is not some kind of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/04/25/what-all-that-gushing-over-melania-trump-really-means/">“resistance” hero</a>. As First Lady, she was not secretly working to undermine the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-second-term-agenda.html">Donald Trump</a> administration; she mostly kept to herself, except for when she wore an <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/melania-trump-do-you-care.html">offensive jacket</a> and accidentally revealed she doesn’t <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/09/melania-trump-does-give-a-f-k-about-christmas-ornaments.html">“give a fuck”</a> about Christmas.</p><p>But I do respect one thing about Melania: She did not express any support for her husband whatsoever as he was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">tried and convicted on 34 felony counts</a> for paying hush money to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-criminal-trial.html">Stormy Daniels</a>, the porn star with whom he allegedly had an affair while married to Melania.</p><p>At first, Melania’s absence from the courthouse wasn’t <em>too</em> conspicuous. She primed us to expect that she’d steer clear of the hush-money trial by skipping nearly every Trump political and court appearance for more than a year. In fact, Melania has given barely any indication that she backs Trump’s 2024 campaign: She gave a single pro-Trump reelection <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/05/melania-trump-supports-donald-but-keeps-her-distance.html">statement</a> to Fox News Digital, joined her husband to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/melania-trump-back-missing-again.html">vote in Florida’s GOP primary</a>, and showed up to a few of the campaign fundraisers held at her own home.</p><p>In the past week, the Trump family quietly turned up the pressure on Melania to offer some sign of support for the former president. Eric had regularly attended court with his father, sometimes bringing his wife, Lara. Don Jr. made it to court twice, though he’s been recovering from knee surgery, and he’s been shoutily defending his father online all along. During Tuesday’s closing arguments, even <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/where-ivanka-melania-trump-trial.html">Tiffany Trump</a> and her husband, Michael Boulos, were by Donald’s side.</p><p>That left only three members of Trump’s immediate family who hadn’t publicly offered any words of encouragement: <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/ivanka-trump-wont-be-seen-with-dad-post-indictment-news.html">Ivanka</a>, Melania, and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-barron-graduation-fundraiser.html">Barron</a> (who does not count because he’s a high-schooler who’s never spoken publicly).</p><p>Then, at the very last minute, Ivanka broke. When the verdict came down on Thursday afternoon, her Instagram Stories featured a video of her son swinging a golf club to the Eagles song “Take It Easy.”</p><figure>

  </figure><p>Perhaps realizing that’s too chill a vibe for the day your dad becomes a convicted felon, on Thursday evening she posted this:</p><figure>

Does she agree with <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@DonaldJTrumpJr/posts/112532269230957495">Don Jr.</a> that “the Democrats have succeeded in their yearslong attempt to turn America into a third-world shithole”? Unclear! All we know is that she officially continues to love her dad.</p><p>And what about Melania? Well, she wasn’t at court when the verdict was read; Eric was the only family member in New York with Donald on Thursday. And nearly 24 hours later, she hasn’t released a statement or even posted a four-word message affirming her general affection for Donald J. Trump. She has only posted twice on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@MelaniaTrump">Truth Social</a> and Instagram in the last week, one to mark Memorial Day:</p><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7eQFpBunZx/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14" style=" background:#FFF;

        </figure><p>The independent presidential candidacy of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/kennedy-confederate-monuments.html">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> is at an important juncture that may determine whether it becomes a significant part of the 2024 story or just a footnote. Historically, non-major-party candidacies (at least those since 1912) have <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/kennedy-2024-polling-boom-unlikely.html">begun to lose altitude</a> as Election Day grows closer and potential voters worry about “wasting” their votes on nonviable options. Kennedy is still <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/05/28/rfk-jr-says-hell-be-on-the-ballot-in-these-states-with-more-in-the-works-his-campaign-says/?sh=8e5bc2d69c27">struggling to secure ballot access</a>, particularly in presidential battleground states, and he does not appear poised to seriously compete for any electoral votes despite attracting a robust share of the national electorate (an even 10 percent in the <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden-vs-kennedy-vs-west-vs-stein">RealClearPolitics polling averages</a> and 10.1 percent at <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">FiveThirtyEight</a>).</p><p>Another factor potentially marginalizing the Kennedy candidacy is the fact that he is (generally speaking) drawing roughly equal support from voters who would otherwise back <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-needs-disengaged-unhappy-voters-to-stay-home.html">Joe Biden</a> or <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-guilty-verdict-would-feed-election-denial-claims.html">Donald Trump</a>. Though both the major-party campaigns are watching him nervously and occasionally taking shots at him, at present RFK Jr. doesn’t seem to be significantly affecting the likely outcome.</p><p>All that could change if the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-biden-debate-agreement.html">first presidential debate</a>, scheduled for June 27 in Atlanta, includes Kennedy along with Biden and Trump. It may not be a coincidence that the only independent candidate ever to secure a spot on the stage with both Democratic and Republican nominees, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/ross-perot-will-remain-a-legend-among-foes-of-partisanship.html">Ross Perot</a> in 1992, also wound up with the largest percentage of the vote (18.9 percent), even though he dropped out for several weeks in the middle of the campaign season before reentering. For RFK Jr., participating in the unusually early debate sponsored by CNN could be an extraordinarily well-timed tonic for his troops, heading off the summer blahs and boosting his already high name ID.</p><p>But there’s a big catch: Biden proposed (and Trump accepted) the debates with the understanding it would be a one-on-one matchup with the former president. And CNN promptly established <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/qualifications-for-june-27-cnn-presidential-debate/index.html">participation criteria</a> (clearly modeled on those previously set out by the now-discarded bipartisan <a href="https://apnews.com/article/commission-presidential-debates-future-nonpartisan-early-voters-01a7cfe1817dc110d14635536f1f86b1">Commission on Presidential Debates</a>) that create clear obstacles to RFK Jr. joining the fray. On the one hand, he has a decent chance of meeting the polling criteria, having already obtained three of the required four specific polls showing him with at least 15 percent of the vote; he needs just one more by the cutoff date of June 20. The much bigger problem, however, is this requirement: “Candidates must also appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency.”</p><p>CNN has indicated it will treat Biden and Trump as having met this requirement as “presumptive” nominees of major parties with 50-state ballot access, even though neither man will officially become nominees by June 20. Kennedy, however, needs to show that states adding up to 270 electoral votes have actually certified his ballot access (mostly subsequent to petitions, though in at least two states, RFK Jr. has obtained <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/02/rfk-jr-california-ballot-american-independent-party/">minor-party nominations</a>). And he’s some distance from that goal, as <em>Forbes</em> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/05/28/rfk-jr-says-hell-be-on-the-ballot-in-these-states-with-more-in-the-works-his-campaign-says/?sh=47248ccd69c2">explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Kennedy has officially gained ballot access in seven states — Utah, Michigan, California, Delaware, Oklahoma, Hawaii and Texas — according to his campaign, which said it has collected enough signatures to be placed on the ballot in nine others—New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Idaho, Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey and New York.</p></blockquote><p>Add all those up, and Kennedy has arguably qualified in 16 states representing 229 electoral votes. But that’s not the same as being state-certified for ballot access, which can take a lot of time. So even as his campaign scrambles for petitions and fights off obstruction from the major parties (particularly from Democrats, who are clearly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-mobilize-stop-rfk-jr-cutting-biden-rcna145952">trying to minimize</a> Kennedy ballot access), RFK Jr. is challenging CNN’s participation criteria (which have been largely replicated by September 10 debate sponsor <a href="https://abc.com/news/6abdd5ab-5cdc-48c2-8184-8be2f1a532c1/category/1138628">ABC</a>), as the Washington <em>Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/29/kennedy-debate-fec-complaint/">reports</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The presidential campaign of independent candidate <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/candidates/robert-kennedy-jr-2024/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10&itid=lk_inline_manual_2">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> announced Wednesday it had filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission about Kennedy’s potential exclusion from a planned June 27 debate on CNN between <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/candidates/joe-biden-2024/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2">President Biden</a> and former president <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2">Donald Trump</a>.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the <a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/joinkennedy/pages/15312/attachments/original/1716950410/FEC-Complaint-Kennedy-Biden-Trump.pdf?1716950410">complaint</a>, filed Tuesday, Kennedy’s campaign alleges that Biden, Trump, their respective campaigns and CNN “colluded” to leave Kennedy off the debate stage. The complaint also alleges that CNN’s decision to hold the debate could be tantamount to the network making “prohibited corporate contributions” to Biden and Trump’s campaigns and thus violate the Federal Election Campaign Act.</p></blockquote><p>The campaign-finance argument is clearly a reach, since there’s a pretty clear media exception from rules governing corporate contributions. But otherwise, there’s no legal principle whereby CNN can’t set whatever rules it wants. Team Kennedy is likely working the refs and counting on public pressure to convince CNN to relax its ballot-access criteria on grounds that it creates a double standard benefiting major-party candidates who won’t officially qualify for a single ballot before July (when Republicans formally nominate Trump) and August (when Biden will become the Democratic nominee).</p><p>Even if Kennedy gets his way with CNN, there’s a decent chance the Biden campaign could withdraw its own pledge to participate since it didn’t bargain for a three-cornered event (the Trump campaign has not objected to Kennedy’s participation, which may be an indication as to whose candidacy he is more likely to hurt or help in the end).</p><p>Having said all that, it’s difficult to calculate the effect on the campaign of Kennedy appearing on the big stage. Presumably, a lot of voters know little about RFK Jr. himself beyond his famous name and perhaps his skepticism about vaccines. Exposure to his full panoply of claims that corporations and government agencies are systematically conspiring to poison both people and the planet could turn heads in unpredictable ways. But obviously, he has to grab the biggest spotlight he can, even if it results in voters fleeing from his candidacy with horror or choosing to dismiss politics entirely as a crazy game with no winners.</p><div><p>More on politics</p><ul><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Trump Will Appeal: Live Updates</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-happens-to-donald-trump-now-that-hes-been-convicted.html">What Happens to Trump Now?</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/does-the-conservative-rage-machine-go-to-11.html">Does the Conservative Rage Machine Go to 11?</a></li></ul></div>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p>The phrase “convicted felon <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-was-convicted-but-prosecutors-contorted-the-law.html">Donald Trump</a>” has a nice ring to it for the many Americans who would like to see the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-could-be-one-gag-order-violation-from-jail.html">ex-president in jail</a>. But <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgg4kv0682o">experts say</a> it was always unlikely that Trump would leave the courthouse in handcuffs after <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">his guilty verdict</a>. And Trump will probably remain free on bail in the weeks leading up to his sentencing on July 11 — just four days before the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/01/naming-him-presumptive-nominee-too-much-even-for-trump.html">Republican National Convention</a> starts.</p><p>For Trump, the next month could involve several trips back to New York, where he will sit through the humbling process of inmate review, in which the New York City Department of Probation will interview the incoming felon prior to sentencing. On the 10th floor of the courthouse where he spent the last six weeks, a psychologist or social worker will ask Trump about his mental health, personal history, and employment status. At this point, Trump can also make a case for “why he or she deserves a lighter punishment,” <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/criminal/preSentenceReport.shtml">according to</a> the New York State Unified Court System. Trump’s responses and the probation office’s interview — including a sentencing recommendation — will be summarized in a report for Judge Merchan.</p><p>For Trump’s attorneys, the next big deadline comes on June 13, when his defense team and prosecutors will file sentencing memos making the case for what they consider an appropriate punishment. Merchan will take these documents into consideration when he decides on sentencing Trump — a nonviolent offender with no criminal record who was convicted of Class-E felonies, the lowest tier of felonies in New York state.</p><p>Each count carries a max sentence of four years in prison, though Merchan will take into account Trump’s age and clean criminal record. While <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/trump-guilty-crime-felony-what-happens-next.html">experts think</a> any time in prison is unlikely, he could face fines and probation. In his rambling press conference on Friday, Trump <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">announced</a> he would appeal his conviction — a process that would begin after sentencing and would most likely not be resolved until after the election.</p><p>Trump will be free to cross the country on his reelection campaign at least until his July sentencing. For now, though, the gag order that barred him from speaking about the witnesses on the case still remains. In his <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">press conference</a> on Friday, Trump appeared to violate the order by referring to a certain “sleazebag” attorney that was obviously Michael Cohen. If Merchan decides to act on his threat to detain Trump for repeated violations of the order, former Department of Corrections officials told <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/where-would-trump-go-to-jail-if-held-in-contempt-again.html">Intelligencer</a> that he could either be held in a cell at 100 Centre St. for a few short hours, or be sent to his own wing with Secret Service protection at Rikers Island if he is to stay the night.</p><p>If Trump is sentenced to probation, state law would require him to clear any travel outside of New York with a probation officer, which would certainly complicate his presidential campaign. Experts who spoke with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/29/trump-if-convicted-hush-money-trial-new-york/">Washington <em>Post</em></a> said that if Trump were to be hit with home confinement, the authorities in New York would have to coordinate with officers in Florida to make home detention work. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/can-trump-vote-november-convicted-felony-new-york-rcna154286">Most likely, he will be able to vote in November</a>; while Florida bars felons convicted in Florida from voting, it respects out-of-state voting restrictions when a felon is convicted elsewhere.</p><p>Being convicted isn’t all bad news for the former president. Trump has leaned further into the <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112533520422256459">messaging</a> that he is being “persecuted” in an act tantamount to “election interference,” and that message appears to be resonating. Though the campaign’s claims have not been verified by FEC filings yet, they say Trump raised an <a href="https://x.com/kenvogel/status/1796550773637304679">historic</a> $34.8 million in the hours since his conviction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p>Uh-oh. They’re angry now!</p><p>The conservative response to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Donald Trump’s first criminal conviction</a> has been an outpouring of demonstrative wrath. “It has never been more incumbent upon the Right to <em>finally</em> wake up and realize what is going on right now in this once-great nation,” thunders <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/05/31/post-trump_verdict_will_the_american_right_finally_wake_up_151028.html">one</a> conservative columnist. “From now on, the civil war inside the GOP will be between those who understand they must do to Democrats what Democrats have done to Trump, and those who think they can trundle along with business as usual,” exclaims <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2024/05/31/after-trumps-conviction-republicans-should-do-to-democrats-what-they-did-to-him/">another</a>.</p><p>The mood extends from the Trumpiest corners of the conservative movement to its anti-anti-Trump wing. “Lotta Republicans who are in no way fans of Trump are outraged tonight at this egregious abuse of law,” notes <em>National Review</em>’s <a href="https://x.com/baseballcrank/status/1796323839170982250">Dan McLaughlin</a>. “Through two primaries and two general elections I have never voted for Trump. I would crawl over broken glass to vote for him now,” proclaims the Washington <em>Examiner</em>’s <a href="https://x.com/conncarroll/status/1796292876378218512">Conn Carroll</a>.</p><p>The intended message of all these responses is that Alvin Bragg, Judge Juan Merchan, and 12 jurors — or, as conservatives put it, “the Democrats” — have launched an attack so brazen it has snapped the conservatives awake from their stupor. They are insistent that the New York ruling has changed something about <em>them</em>.</p><p>Envisioning a world in which Republicans feel angry does not exactly strain the frontiers of our imaginations. While politics often involves getting people angry about the opposing side, the conservative movement has existed in a continuous state of terror and rage for its entire existence.</p><p>The first time I encountered the arresting image of a Republican who would crawl over broken glass to cast a vote was during the 2000 election. “Broken-glass Republicans” described an entire category of voter. The broken-glass Republicans of 2000 were so incandescently furious that Bill Clinton had <em>lied</em> about a <em>sexual affair</em> without legal <em>consequences</em> that they would do anything to prevent his totally innocent vice-president Al Gore from succeeding him.</p><p>Today, Republicans feel so angry a president <em>is</em> facing legal consequences for lying about an affair that they are again insisting they will crawl over broken glass to vote Republican. Perhaps there is a common thread here, and it is not a principled conservative belief on criminalizing the cover-up of a sexual affair.</p><p>When they offer specifics about what’s changed, conservatives insist that they now want to prosecute their political enemies. “Something that’s going to happen now that Democrats have prosecuted their main political opponent is they are going to tell voters it would be dangerous to elect Trump because he would seek to use the legal system to get revenge on his political opponents,” sniffs Republican consultant <a href="https://x.com/NoahPollak/status/1796317642254672318">Noah Pollak</a>. The Federalist’s <a href="https://x.com/seanmdav/status/1796301843338789070">Sean Davis</a> instructs Republicans, “Give me a list of which Democrat officials you’re going to put in prison, or get lost.”</p><p>Of course, these lists already exist. A list of the critics Donald Trump has labeled as criminals includes but is by no means limited to Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, James Comey, and vast swaths of the government bureaucracy, some of whom he targeted with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/01/the-durham-probe-was-barrs-witch-hunt.html">flimsy criminal investigations that collapsed in court</a>.</p><p>Trump was framing his candidacy as one of “vengeance” a year ago. He was threatening to lock up his main rival eight years ago. To watch Republicans present these impulses as recourse they are only turning to now is an offense against not only logic but the space-time continuum. Next thing you know, Trump is going to be so angry about his conviction that he will resort to attempting to overturn an election result.</p><p>The whole supposed cause of Trump’s candidacy to begin with was a series of cultural and political slights that drove Republicans into his arms. The “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-antons-flight-93-election-trump-coup.html">Flight 93 Election</a>” was the most dramatic rendering of this rationale, but less deranged conservatives than Michael Anton shared his basic reasoning that they were forced to support an admittedly flawed vessel like Donald Trump in order to stave off the horrible things that Hillary Clinton had done to them.</p><p>By now, most conservatives have forgotten the particulars that drove them to this state of panic and rage in 2016. They are stuck in a recursive loop of anger, waking up every morning as innocent babes, exposed to new affronts against their honor and driven to revenge. Somehow, things they did eight years ago can be cast as responses to the offenses they endure today.</p><p>You don’t need to completely dismiss Republican skepticism of the Manhattan case against Trump. It is a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-was-convicted-but-prosecutors-contorted-the-law.html">borderline case</a>, one that almost certainly would not have been brought against an ordinary defendant.</p><p>However, Republicans can also acknowledge the unfairness of this case without spiraling into paranoia. Alvin Bragg is not “the Democrats,” and there is literally zero evidence that President Biden or the national party had any role in bringing these charges forward. And while it didn’t need to be brought, the case wasn’t meritless, as evidenced by the quick and unanimous agreement by the jury. (Yes, it took place in New York, but Trump held a rally in the city as recently as one week ago to demonstrate his support there — finding a single juror sympathetic enough to judge the facts fairly was a low burden.)</p><p>Trump has not been sentenced and can still appeal the case. More to the point, he can still run for president, and his supporters mostly say this verdict won’t harm him and might help.</p><p>However slanted against him this one case might have been, the overall suite of criminal charges he faces has treated him more than favorably. To Trump’s great benefit, the charge in which he is most indisputably guilty — stealing classified documents and covering up the theft — has been delayed to death by a friendly judge he appointed. Drawing a tough judge and prosecutor in one case is very different than saying the legal system has railroaded Trump. The opposite is closer to correct.</p><p>I’d advise them to step back and take a breath, except it would just make them angry. Everything makes them angry. Perhaps this is how we got here in the first place.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p>West Virginia senator <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/09/joe-manchin-energy-proposal-wont-cause-government-shutdown.html">Joe Manchin</a> has long been a vestige of a bygone age in which relatively conservative politicians, especially from relatively conservative states, were plentiful in the Democratic Party. When the 76-year-old two-term incumbent and former governor announced his <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/joe-manchin-announces-end-of-senate-career-new-2024-threat.html">retirement from the Senate</a> last November and then <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/joe-manchin-wont-run-for-president-after-all.html">passed up an independent presidential run</a> earlier this year, it appeared he would drift off into history as one of the last of his breed. He had very recently even reinforced his tenuous ties to the Democrats he has disrespected regularly by <a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/politics/manchin-addresses-rumors-about-run-for-wv-governor/article_2a9995e2-0f63-5fe9-94ca-59f4ad4f0e73.html">endorsing</a> the party’s nominee for West Virginia governor, Steve Williams.</p><p>But now, halfway out the door, Manchin has suddenly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/west-virginia-sen-joe-manchin-leaves-democratic-party-registers-independent">announced</a> he is switching his voter registration status from Democratic to independent. The timing is almost certainly significant: Today is the final day West Virginia candidates can establish their party status for the 2024 general election. Now, Manchin has until August 1, in theory, to decide whether to abandon retirement and run for another Senate term as an independent, or perhaps abandon Williams and run for governor, a position he held from 2005 to 2010.</p><p>Even as an independent, and even if all this waffling over his intentions doesn’t offend West Virginia voters, this isn’t a particularly good time for Manchin or any other non-Republican to run for statewide office in that state, which <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-trump-will-campaign-as-a-convicted-felon.html">Donald Trump</a> won by <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/West_Virginia">42 points in 2016 and 39 points in 2020</a>. His Senate seat will almost certainly be occupied by Governor <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/gop-gets-prize-recruit-jim-justice-to-take-on-joe-manchin.html">Jim Justice</a>, a longtime Manchin rival who is himself a former Democrat. Before Manchin announced his retirement, Justice was <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/senate/general/2024/west-virginia/manchin-vs-justice">leading him by double digits</a> in the polls. Loyalty to Williams aside, a gubernatorial run might make more sense: Republican nominee <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/02/west-virginias-statewide-teachers-strike-continues.html">Patrick Morrisey</a> isn’t terribly popular; he just won a close and complicated GOP primary; and he lost to Manchin in a 2018 Senate race.</p><p>But who knows what Manchin is thinking? He’s been playing Hamlet for a long time, both in West Virginia, where his political future has been a constant topic of puzzled speculation for decades now, and in Washington, where he has thoroughly enjoyed driving his fellow Democrats nuts with his demands for legislative concessions to keep his vote in the party column. Nobody has forgotten his <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/11/joe-manchins-reign-as-king-of-america-is-over.html">two-year reign as King of America</a>, when Democratic control of the chamber was constantly threatened by Manchin and his sidekick, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/kyrsten-sinema-senate-retirement.html">Kyrsten Sinema</a> (who is also leaving the Senate this year); they did eventually <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/08/whats-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-the-senate-just-passed.html">allow Joe Biden</a> some significant accomplishments, but not without quite a bit of pain and angst. Manchin has been a bit of a lame duck since Democrats lost the House in 2022 (while picking up a Senate seat to reduce any one senator’s leverage), ending the trifecta that gave him his power to make or break legislation. So his drift toward a post-political retirement seemed inevitable — until now.</p><p>As we await the final word on Manchin’s future, his newly independent status adds another member to the odd pack of indies participating in the Senate Democratic Caucus:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Depending how you count Menendez, who’s readying to run as an independent (mostly to keep legal options open), senate is now 46 D, 49 R, 5 I (Sanders, King, Sinema, Manchin, Menendez) <a href="https://t.co/MHPjP7JjiA">https://t.co/MHPjP7JjiA</a></p>&mdash; David Weigel (@daveweigel) <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1796546979327340874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Democrats will mourn the likely loss of his Senate seat, but they may be quite happy to give Joe Manchin a ticket to the political boneyard. The West Virginian, however, will have the satisfaction of saying that he broke up with them first.</p><div><p>More on politics</p><ul><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Donald Trump Found Guilty on All Counts: Live Updates</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/texas-gop-abortion-platform.html">Texas GOP Exposes Ugly Truth About Letting States Ban Abortion</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-happens-to-donald-trump-now-that-hes-been-convicted.html">What Happens to Trump Now?</a></li></ul></div>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-guilty-verdict-would-feed-election-denial-claims.html">Donald Trump</a> hopes that taking a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/two-big-lies-trump-is-telling-on-abortion.html">“states-rights” approach</a> to abortion policy will <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-triangulation-abortion.html">take this issue off the table</a> for his presidential race. That gambit should fail, for multiple reasons. First, nobody has <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-would-anyone-trust-trump-on-abortion.html">any reason to trust</a> a hands-off pledge from the man who <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/06/supreme-court-ending-roe-v-wade-is-trumps-big-payback.html">promised and then secured</a> a Supreme Court that would <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/06/the-supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade-in-abortion-case.html">reverse <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Wade</em></a>. He’s had a more malign effect on abortion rights than any one person in America, with the arguable exception of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/abortion-pill-supreme-court-shadow-docket-samuel-alito.html">Samuel Alito</a>. Second, there are a lot of things short of a legislative ban that a President Trump could do to make life hell for women needing abortion care and those providing it.</p><p>But beyond all these ways in which bad national abortion policy might be made under an allegedly state-run legal regime, let’s not forget the injustices being performed regularly in Republican-controlled states themselves. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-abortion-bans">Seventeen states</a> currently ban abortion either totally or by six weeks of pregnancy. One of the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-abortion-bans">14 states with total bans</a> is Texas, the second-largest state with a population of 30 million. This is a state totally controlled by one of the most radical Republican parties in the country, particularly on any issue related to reproductive rights. And without question, Texas Republicans want to make it hazardous for women and their health-care providers, families, and friends to even <em>think</em> about obtaining an abortion. The <a href="https://convention.texasgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-TEMPORARY-Platform-FINAL.pdf">Texas GOP platform</a> adopted this week makes that abundantly clear.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some of the language in this platform relating to abortion policy. It begins with the preamble, which includes a pledge to do “our solemn duty to protect innocent life.” We learn this means banning abortion in the next section of the platform, the party’s “Principles,” the second of which professes belief in the “sanctity of innocent human life, created in the image of God, which should be equally protected from fertilization to natural death.” Note the reference point of “fertilization,” not just “conception,” to make it clear every fertilized ovum should be regarded as equal in legal status to the woman in whose body that ovum is produced. Texas prosecutors haven’t yet gone after IVF clinics or the use of IUDs or emergency contraception, but it looks like Republicans may be going there eventually.</p><p>At first, the omission of any federal “right-to-life” constitutional amendment in the long section on such amendments seems like a sign of moderation, until you realize Texas Republicans believe the U.S. Constitution <em>already</em> confers absolute fetal rights: “We urge lawmakers to enact legislation to abolish abortion by immediately securing the right to life and equal protection of the laws to all preborn children from the moment of fertilization, because abortion violates the United States Constitution by denying such persons the equal protection of the law” (Plank 35).</p><p>Perhaps the zaniest provision (Plank 95) of the Texas GOP platform mandates anti-abortion education in public schools, which are otherwise banned from any instruction touching on human sexuality (Plank 85). This mandate is incredibly prescriptive:</p><blockquote><p>We support requiring Texas students to learn about the humanity of the preborn child, including life-affirming definitions of life and the study of life, the concept that life begins at fertilization, milestones of fetal development at two-week gestational intervals, use of fetal baby models, witnessing of a live ultrasound, viewing the following videos: <em>Meet Baby Olivia</em>, <em>A Glimpse Inside</em>, and <em>Miracle of Life</em>, and (for high school students) the contents of the <em>Woman’s Right to Know</em> booklet. In addition, students should receive instruction on the dignity of human life and the principles of equal protection that were instituted in the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution.</p></blockquote><p>There are random anti-abortion provisions scattered through the rest of the platform (e.g., Plank 163, which essentially calls for charging physicians performing elective abortions with homicide), until you reach the mother lode, Plank 191, entitled, rather redundantly, “Abolish Abortion”:</p><blockquote><p>Since life begins at fertilization, we urge the Texas Legislature to abolish abortion through enacting legislation that would immediately secure the right to life and would nullify any and all federal statutes, regulations, orders, and court rulings that would deny these rights. We urge the Texas legislature to enact legislation to abolish abortion by immediately securing the right to life and equal protection of the laws to all preborn children from the moment of fertilization and to oppose legislation that discriminates against any preborn children and violates the United States Constitution by denying such persons the equal protection of the laws, and to adopt effective tools to ensure the enforcement of our laws to protect life when doctors or district attorneys fail to do so.</p></blockquote><p>Keep in mind that Texas already has world-class anti-abortion laws that aim to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/17/1252218618/interstate-travel-becomes-a-target-for-the-anti-abortion-movement-with-texas-fil">discourage out-of-state travel</a> to secure legal abortions and <a href="https://www.villanovalawreview.com/post/2229-crossing-state-lines-texas-s-abortion-bounty-hunter-law-implicates-those-who-assist-individuals-to-get-an-abortion-out-of-state-including-employers">authorize private lawsuits</a> against anyone aiding or abetting in abortions, legal or illegal. Apparently, Texas Republicans fear the possibility of loopholes in the forced-birth system.</p><p>Believe it or not, the explicit abortion provisions of the Texas Republican platform I’ve cited don’t make their overall extremism as clear as they really are, as abortion-rights journalist Jessica Valenti <a href="https://jessica.substack.com/p/texas-gop-platform-endorses-death">explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We need to talk about Plank 35 in the <a href="https://convention.texasgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-TEMPORARY-Platform-FINAL.pdf">Texas GOP platform</a> …</p><p><br /></p><p>The GOP’s platform demands “equal protection for the preborn,” and for Texas legislation to give fertilized eggs, embryos, and fetuses “equal protection of the law.”</p></blockquote><p>Actually, this “equal protection” language is repeated multiple times in the document.</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a regular reader, <a href="https://jessica.substack.com/i/128553321/keep-an-eye-on">you know</a> that “equal protection” is a call for abortion to be treated as homicide, and for abortion patients to be prosecuted as murders. (Remember South Carolina’s <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess125_2023-2024/bills/3549.htm">Prenatal Equal Protection Act</a>, and Georgia’s <a href="https://legiscan.com/GA/text/HB496/id/2712441">Prenatal Equal Protection Act</a>? Both were bills to make abortion punishable as a homicide.)</p><p><br /></p><p>That’s because “equal protection” is the polite-sounding rallying cry of <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1198912380">abortion ‘abolitionists’</a> — radical anti-abortion activists who say women aren’t victims in abortion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/abortion-abolitionists.html">but killers.</a> The once-fringe group has been gaining more power and influence since <em>Roe</em> was overturned, with some <a href="https://jessica.substack.com/p/abortion-every-day-101623#:~:text=Finally%2C%20in,and%20here.)">running for and winning state office.</a></p></blockquote><p>Recall that Plank 191 adopts the “abolitionist” framework, intended, among other things, to identify radical anti-abortionists with those who fought to abolish slavery. Talk about an Orwellian inversion of language!</p><p>Trump and other Republicans can prattle all day long about respecting the autonomy of the states and their voters and legislators in setting abortion policy as though it’s strictly a matter of common-sense federalism. But you can’t talk away the fact that thanks to Trump and the U.S. Supreme Court, women in Texas (and other states) are treated like potential murderers and (if they try to flee to “free” states) runaway slaves if they seek to exert any bodily autonomy. That is no “compromise” position — especially because Republicans are clearly looking to eventually outlaw abortion from Maine to California.</p><div><p>More on life after roe</p><ul><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/texas-gop-abortion-platform.html">Texas GOP Exposes Ugly Truth About Letting States Ban Abortion</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-triangulation-abortion.html">Don’t Be Fooled by Trump’s Triangulation on Abortion</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/alito-flag-is-symbol-of-new-partisan-era-at-supreme-court.html">Alito Home’s Flag Is Symbol of New Partisan Era at Supreme Court</a></li></ul></div>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p>When people asked me what it was like inside the courthouse where <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Donald Trump stood trial</a>, I said it reminded me of covering a political convention. It was a programmed event, with tentpole speakers, like <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-cohen-finally-talks-back-to-the-boss-donald-trump.html">the star witness, Michael Cohen</a>. There was a nominee, chosen by indictment, who swept in each day with a swarm of loyal surrogates. There was press pack, wearing credentials on their lanyards, all writing down the same words, and breathing the same stale air. After final arguments, though, the atmosphere shifted. As the case went to the voters of the jury, it felt more like Election Day, when there’s nothing left to do but wait. The reporters hung around the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal-court building, trading theories and gossip, trying out takes.</p><p>The <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-jury-deliberation.html">jury of 12 New Yorkers</a> — seven men, five women — seemed to be in no hurry. At the end of their first day of deliberations, May 29, they passed a couple of notes to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/juan-marchan-trump-least-favorite-judge.html">Judge Juan Merchan</a>, asking for a read-back of some testimony and, more significantly, his jury instructions. The next morning, Thursday, they all filed back into the courtroom and Merchan once again gave his explanation of the law. You couldn’t blame the jurors for wanting to hear it a second time.</p><figure>
  <img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dea/e38/7f8d16130fe77f8bf3bcef7b457b5173e4-izzy0315.2x.rhorizontal.w700.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Art: Isabelle Bourman</figcaption>
  </figure><p>The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, had advanced a complex theory of the case, in which one intended crime (a conspiracy to win election via illegal means) was accomplished through a second intended crime (the jury could take its pick from several options, including the violation of federal campaign-finance laws), and concealed through a third crime. The charges Trump faced, 34 counts of falsifying business records, related only to the coverup. The <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-was-convicted-but-prosecutors-contorted-the-law.html">triple bank shot elevated the business-records charge, </a>normally a misdemeanor, into a felony. But it also served a larger justification for the prosecutors, who had been criticized for singling Trump out for a minor offense. It allowed them to say that the case was about something more nefarious than having a sexual encounter with a porn star, or paying hush money through a lawyer, or conspiring with the chief executive of the <em>National Enquirer</em> to keep a candidate’s secrets.</p><p>In his summation, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jurors they should analyze the evidence through “the prism” of “three rich and powerful men, high up in Trump Tower, trying to become even more powerful by controlling the flow of information that might reach the voters.” In other words, he was saying, the underlying crime was the denial of knowledge.</p><p>Going into the trial, many legal commentators — even ones who otherwise hated Trump — questioned whether Bragg’s theory would hold up. But Merchan had largely accepted it, and his instructions were written in a way that seemed to point in one direction. As Merchan read them to the jury again, Trump sat with his eyes closed. But he belatedly woke up to the fact that the boring stuff was worth his attention. In the afternoon, from the courthouse holding room that he used as his command center, he posted to Truth Social that the instructions were “UNFAIR, MISLEADING, INACCURATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL.” His lawyers had promised to appeal any guilty verdict, and they stood a decent chance on the merits. But for now, Merchan’s word was law.</p><p>Trump has spent this unusual election year treating his court dates as an extension of his campaign. During the primary season, he spent much of his time at two civil trials, one for corporate fraud and the other for defamation. In each case he has adopted his familiar political strategy, picking out his opponents — judges, prosecutors, even a court clerk — and savaging them on social media. Before the criminal trial began, he attacked Merchan as a biased hack, calling attention to the judge’s (tiny) political donations to liberal causes and the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant. When a gag order, and the threat of being jailed for contempt, finally forced Trump to lay off, he called in reinforcements. “It is a political persecution, it is a witch hunt,” Donald Trump Jr. told the TV cameras outside the courthouse after watching closing arguments. He then singled out a member of the prosecution team who previously served as an acting associate attorney general. “There is a reason one of the people sitting at that desk was the number-three person in Joe Biden’s DOJ. I know my father is not allowed to say ‘Matthew Colangelo,’ because he’s been gagged. The president of the United States is not allowed to exercise his First Amendment rights in New York City, in this day and age.”</p><p>Trump has discovered, however, that the demean-and-destroy strategy that works so well for him as a candidate is less effective within the legal system. Merchan is silver-haired and generally soft-spoken, but his demeanor belied a determination to bring Trump to trial, kicking and screaming. While Trump’s legal team successfully managed to tie up his federal cases with appeals and procedural motions, Merchan kept the New York State case running on a tight schedule. He denied the defense’s attempts to significantly delay the trial over evidentiary issues. He kept juror selection moving along quickly, and the jurors turned out to be diligent and committed. He held Trump in line. On the second day of jury selection, he noticed the defendant was audibly complaining. “I will not tolerate that,” Merchan told him. “I will not have any jurors intimidated in my courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear.” After that, Trump hardly uttered a peep.</p><p>Six weeks after the trial began, the case went to the jury. At around 4 p.m. on Thursday afternoon, the prosecution and defense lawyers, as well as Trump, reentered the courtroom, where the reporters in the gallery were lazily passing the afternoon. Merchan came in and gave them a routine update: He would be telling the jury to go home for the day as scheduled, at 4:30. “We’ll give them a few more minutes,” he said, before disappearing out the side door. The judge was gone for a little while, and then he returned, with an odd look on his face.</p><p>“I apologize for the delay,” Merchan said. “We received a note. It was signed by the jury foreperson at 4:20. It’s marked as Court Exhibit Number 7. It reads: ‘We, the jury, have a verdict.’” From the gallery, there was an audible gasp, and the clatter of laptops. “Please,” the judge said, “let there be no outbursts, no reactions of any kind once we take a verdict.”</p><p>Eric Trump, the sole member of the defendant’s family present, stalked out of the courtroom, wearing a stricken expression, and returned a few minutes later. His father sat at the defense table, his arms crossed over his bright blue tie, and then leaned in as his attorney, Todd Blanche, whispered to him behind his hand. He turned up his chin and prepared to take the punch. He stood as the jurors filed into the hushed room without giving him a look. And then the foreman, an Irish immigrant, pronounced him guilty, 34 times over.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>Blanche asked, as a formality, for the jurors to be polled. Trump turned to look at them one more time as each was asked if they agreed with the verdict, and each answered: “Yes.”</p><p>Otherwise, Trump showed no visible reaction. The man who never admits defeat or accepts punishment had suddenly been rendered helpless before the law. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, four days before his party convenes for its actual political convention in Milwaukee. On his way out of the courtroom, Trump gave a dispirited, jerky handshake to his son, and then walked out to the press pen to deliver a statement. “This was a rigged, disgraceful trial,” he said. “The real verdict is going to be November 5 by the people.” If that one goes his way, Trump will return to power, and he will be able to put off any state-court sentence. He will also be able to order the Department of Justice to dismiss his federal cases. Then, if past is prologue, he will turn to payback, and will seek to lock up his own perceived enemies.</p><p>Even if he never serves a day in jail, though, the felony conviction assures at least one outcome. This time around, there won’t be any conspiracy to hide the truth about the Republican Party’s candidate for president. And the American voters will know exactly what they are getting if they elect him president.

        </figure><p>The first time I ever took a jury verdict, I almost passed out. I was a brand-new prosecutor, 29 years old, and had just given my first closing argument a few days earlier. Since then, the trial team and I had been whiling away our time, interrupted only by the occasional note from the jury seeking testimony or legal instructions as they deliberated. All of a sudden, we got word from the court clerk: Come on up, we have a verdict.</p><p>Let me tell you, there’s little in life that causes a burst of uncut adrenaline quite like the arrival of a verdict. I managed (barely) to hold it together as we performed the arcane, dramatic ritual that concludes every criminal trial. The judge brings the lawyers and the defendant back into the courtroom, the security officers take their places, the jury files in solemnly, and the judge asks: Ladies and gentlemen, have you reached a verdict? (Ummm, yes, Your Honor, that’s why we’re all back out here.) As I stood at the prosecution table while the jury took their places back in the box, I felt dizzy and had to use my arms to brace myself.</p><p>Moments before the jury read the verdict, my supervisor — a grizzled trial buzzsaw known for his blistering closing arguments — leaned over and whispered to me: “Whatever they say, no reaction. Don’t move a muscle.” I don’t know what I would’ve done if not for that last-second command. Maybe I would’ve been sensible enough not to react either way, but I’m not sure. As the jury read out its findings — starting with a “not guilty” on count one, to my horror, but then moving along to a string of convictions — I didn’t budge, or breathe, or blink.</p><p>The lesson I learned that day and throughout my prosecutorial career, and have come to value even more ever since, is that the jury’s verdict is sacrosanct. If a conviction goes our way, we prosecutors don’t pump our fists and celebrate, even mildly. And when a verdict goes against us, we don’t sulk. When we lose, we stand in and take it. Any emotional reaction, either way, would disrespect the judge, the jury, and, most importantly, the person whose liberty was about to be stripped. Prosecutors get to go to dinner and then sleep at home, no matter what the jury says. The defendant might not.</p><p>By any reasonable measure, the jury of Manhattanites who yesterday found former president <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Donald Trump guilty on all 34 charges</a> did its job, and did it well.</p><p>They took on a civic duty from which many others fled; during jury selection, when Judge Juan Merchan allowed potential jurors who did not want to serve essentially to walk out the door, over half the assembled pool headed straight for the exits. The jurors sat through six weeks of testimony, they were by all accounts attentive throughout the trial, and they asked precise, insightful questions of the judge during deliberations. Nobody’s truly in position to say if the jury got it right or wrong; they saw the evidence and we didn’t — most of us, that is, including those like me who followed every line of testimony as it happened; there’s no substitute for seeing it play out live. Reasonable minds could have come out either way, and this jury found that the prosecution carried its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury’s work, and their verdict, deserve respect.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean that every structural infirmity around the Manhattan district attorney’s case has evaporated. Both of these things can be true at once: The jury did its job, and this case was an ill-conceived, unjustified mess. Sure, victory is the great deodorant, but a guilty verdict doesn’t make it all pure and right. Plenty of prosecutors have won plenty of convictions in cases that shouldn’t have been brought in the first place. “But they won” is no defense to a strained, convoluted reach unless the goal is to “win,” now, by any means necessary and worry about the credibility of the case and the fallout later.</p><p>The following are all undeniable facts.</p><p>The judge donated money — a tiny amount, $35, but in plain violation of a <a href="https://ww2.nycourts.gov/rules/chiefadmin/100.shtml">rule</a> prohibiting New York judges from making political donations of any kind — to a pro-Biden, anti-Trump political operation, including funds that the judge <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/07/trump-case-judge-juan-merchan-donated-to-biden-campaign-in-2020/">earmarked</a> for “resisting the Republican Party and Donald Trump’s radical right-wing legacy.” Would folks have been just fine with the judge staying on the case if he had donated a couple bucks to “Re-elect Donald Trump, MAGA forever!”? Absolutely not.</p><p>District Attorney Alvin Bragg ran for office in an overwhelmingly Democratic county by <a href="https://www.oleantimesherald.com/opinion/braggs-trump-indictment-is-a-campaign-promise-kept/article_e7f11833-3c5b-52b7-9c5b-a1018943c3cf.html">touting</a> his Trump-hunting prowess. He bizarrely (and falsely) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/magazine/alvin-bragg-donald-trump-trial.html">boasted</a> on the campaign trail, “It is a fact that I have sued Trump over 100 times.” (Disclosure: Both Bragg and Trump’s lead counsel, Todd Blanche, are friends and former colleagues of mine at the Southern District of New York.)</p><p>Most importantly, the DA’s charges against Trump push the outer boundaries of the law and due process. That’s not on the jury. That’s on the prosecutors who chose to bring the case and the judge who let it play out as it did.</p><p>The district attorney’s press office and its flaks often proclaim that falsification of business records charges are “<a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/85605/survey-of-past-new-york-felony-prosecutions-for-falsifying-business-records/">commonplace</a>” and, indeed, the office’s “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-hush-money-trial-shape-prosecutor-alvin-braggs-legacy-2024-05-23/">bread and butter</a>.” That’s true only if you draw definitional lines so broad as to render them meaningless. Of course the DA charges falsification quite frequently; virtually any fraud case involves some sort of fake documentation.</p><p>But when you impose meaningful search parameters, the truth emerges: The charges against Trump are obscure, and nearly entirely unprecedented. In fact, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/opinion/bragg-trump-trial.html">no state prosecutor</a> — in New York, or Wyoming, or anywhere — has ever charged federal election laws as a direct or predicate state crime, against anyone, for anything. None. Ever. Even putting aside the specifics of election law, the Manhattan DA itself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/magazine/alvin-bragg-donald-trump-trial.html">almost never</a> brings any case in which falsification of business records is the only charge.</p><p>Standing alone, falsification charges would have been mere misdemeanors under New York law, which posed two problems for the DA. First, nobody cares about a misdemeanor, and it would be laughable to bring the first-ever charge against a former president for a trifling offense that falls within the same technical criminal classification as <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/155.25">shoplifting</a> a Snapple and a bag of Cheetos from a bodega. Second, the <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/CPL/30.10">statute of limitations</a> on a misdemeanor — two years — likely has long expired on Trump’s conduct, which dates to 2016 and 2017.</p><p>So, to inflate the charges up to the <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/175.10">lowest-level felony</a> (Class E, on a scale of Class A through E) — and to electroshock them back to life within the longer felony statute of limitations — the DA alleged that the falsification of business records was committed “with intent to commit another crime.” Here, according to prosecutors, the “another crime” is a <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/ELN/17-152">New York State election-law</a> violation, which in turn incorporates three separate “unlawful means”: federal campaign crimes, tax crimes, and falsification of still more documents. Inexcusably, the DA refused to specify what those unlawful means actually were — and the judge declined to force them to pony up — until right before closing arguments. So much for the constitutional obligation to provide notice to the defendant of the accusations against him in advance of trial. (This, folks, is what indictments are for.)</p><p>In these key respects, the charges against Trump aren’t just unusual. They’re bespoke, seemingly crafted individually for the former president and nobody else.</p><p>The Manhattan DA’s employees <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/17/alvin-bragg-stormy-daniels-trump/">reportedly</a> have called this the “Zombie Case” because of various legal infirmities, including its bizarre charging mechanism. But it’s better characterized as the Frankenstein Case, cobbled together with ill-fitting parts into an ugly, awkward, but more-or-less functioning contraption that just might ultimately turn on its creator.</p><p>Trump will appeal, as is his right, and he’s certain to contest the inventive charges constructed by the DA. I won’t go so far as to say an appeals court is likely to overturn a conviction — New York law is broad and hazy enough to (potentially) allow such machinations — but he’s going to have a decent shot at a reversal.</p><p>“No man is above the law.” It’s become cliché, but it’s an important point, and it’s worth pausing to reflect on the importance of this core principle. But it’s also meaningless pablum if we unquestioningly tolerate (or worse, celebrate) deviations from ordinary process and principle to get there. The jury’s word is indeed sacrosanct, as I learned long ago. But it can’t fix everything that preceded it. Here, prosecutors got their man, for now at least — but they also contorted the law in an unprecedented manner in their quest to snare their prey.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared in the free </em><a href="https://cafe.com/article/the-stay-tuned-newsletter/">CAFE Brief</a> <em>newsletter.

        </figure><p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-celebrates-memorial-day-by-defaming-e-jean-carroll.html">Donald Trump</a>’s most important consolation after a Manhattan jury found him <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">guilty of 34 criminal counts</a> is that he has anticipated this moment for a long time. He was <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/">indicted 14 months ago</a> with subsequent criminal indictments following in <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/06/donald-trump-indicted-classified-documents.html">Florida</a>, in <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/08/trump-indicted-in-his-nightmare-jurisdiction-of-georgia.html">Atlanta</a>, and in <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/08/trump-indictment-shows-jack-smith-understands-politics-too.html">Washington</a>. Ever since, he has been running for president as a man under criminal indictment, and coping with that fact has been central to his strategy and message. Indeed, it became clear a long time ago that Trump’s endless preoccupation with his failed 2020 stolen-election fables, a backward-facing stance that initially baffled political observers, was actually a way of conditioning voters to view his future treatment by the justice system skeptically, if not with great hostility.</p><p>During this year’s Republican nominating contest, this strategy <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/could-an-indictment-actually-help-trumps-2024-campaign.html">worked brilliantly</a>, not only insulating Trump from criticism from his rivals about his misconduct in the cases that led to his serial indictments but actually making his alleged criminality a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/27/trump-hush-money-trial-maga-base">badge of honor</a>. His increasingly shrill attacks on the prosecutors he faced helped boost him to an <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/01/new-hampshire-primary-result-shows-no-one-could-beat-trump.html">easy win in the primaries</a> as the hero of conservatives angry at the Democrats and liberal elites seeking to hold him accountable. Now that he has been found guilty in a case brought by a Democratic prosecutor in a dark-blue constituency, to the delight of those liberal elites, Trump can be expected to keep on with the same chest-thumping professions of innocence and victimization (and promises of vengeance) with the Republican Party that has already nominated him dragooned willingly into joining his crusade for vindication.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump’s message: “I’m a political prisoner” <a href="https://t.co/H4al4iYlMF">pic.twitter.com/H4al4iYlMF</a></p>&mdash; Alex Thompson (@AlexThomp) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexThomp/status/1796318857466196310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>There’s no particular reason to doubt that Trump’s ongoing call for loyalty will continue to work with a Republican base that very badly wants to respond to it favorably. Pre-verdict polls have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/trumps-guilty-verdict-impact-2024-presidential-election/story?id=110650906">consistently shown</a> that a significant share of Republicans would “reconsider” their support for Trump if he were convicted of any crime. But “reconsidering” isn’t the same as “abandoning.” As a <a href="https://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1232a22024Election.pdf">May 5 AP-Ipsos poll showed</a>, most of these voters will likely wind up right back in his camp with any encouragement at all (only 4 percent of Trump supporters said they’d drop their allegiance to him after a conviction, and that may be overstating the reaction given <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/10/american-carnage-excerpt-access-hollywood-tape-227269/">past experience</a> with moments when Republicans seemed to be jettisoning the 45th president — but didn’t).</p><p>But even if Trump can confidently count on his base of supporters to stay loyal — indeed, perhaps even cling to him more fiercely than ever as the victim of a “witch hunt” — he must still deal with possible fallout among the small but potentially decisive sliver of swing voters that is open to voting for him but might <em>seriously</em> reconsider voting for a felon. He will need something different from tribal loyalty fed by conspiracy theories to seal the deal in November. For these voters, the key may be to double down on every line of attack on <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-conviction-biden-2024-election.html">Joe Biden</a> as a feckless incompetent and an active danger to the peace and prosperity of America. Conservative Christian activist <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/146758/rod-drehers-race-problem">Rod Dreher</a> may have identified precisely the right precedent for what the Trump campaign will try to do to assuage concerns over his conviction:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I had this bumper sticker on my Louisiana car in 1991, urging my fellow voters to vote for sleazy Edwin Edwards over ex-KKK leader David Duke. After Trump&#39;s felony convictions, I say it&#39;s time to bring it back for the fall election. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trump?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Trump</a> <a href="https://t.co/gK7haOCQYf">pic.twitter.com/gK7haOCQYf</a></p>&mdash; Rod Dreher (@roddreher) <a href="https://twitter.com/roddreher/status/1796293364649775281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Yes, supporters of the ethically challenged Edwin Edwards frontally attacked concerns he was corrupt by minimizing the significance of his corner-cutting as compared to the dire consequences of letting David Duke become chief executive of Louisiana, and what had been a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/07/louisiana-political-legend-edwin-edwards-rip.html">close “race from hell”</a> turned into an Edwards landslide. Nobody will ever mistake Joe Biden for David Duke, but the basic idea of suggesting that a little criminality is better than bad leadership could be fruitfully adapted by the Trump campaign. Trump’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/30/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/sentencing-00160797">sentencing (scheduled for mid-July) by Judge Merchan</a> could create some serious logistical problems for him, restricting his movements while reminding voters he’s on the wrong side of the law. But he is just lucky that the clock has probably run out for any further criminal convictions prior to Election Day that might make the verdict in Manhattan harder to overlook.</p><p>Even if this strategy does not work for Trump and he loses in November, the consequences of the guilty verdict will continue, and not just for the convict. If there was any doubt that Trump will <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-guilty-verdict-would-feed-election-denial-claims.html">deny and reject an election loss even more vociferously</a> than he did in 2020, it should vanish now. Not only is he deeply invested in the claim that his legal peril represents “election interference” by Democrats, but he also needs the kind of get-out-of-jail card a return to the White House might offer.</p><div><p>More on Trump on Trial</p><ul><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Donald Trump Found Guilty on All Counts: Live Updates</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-recap.html">What Happened in the Trump Trial Today: Guilty On All Counts</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-conviction-biden-2024-election.html">Does Trump’s Conviction Mean This Is a New Campaign?</a></li></ul></div>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p>It’s typical for friends and family of the accused to attend “criminal trials to lend moral support to the suspect, and humanize the defendant to the jury,” as the Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/in-court-donald-trump-is-a-loserand-alone">noted</a>. During his <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-are-the-chances-the-trump-trial-ends-in-a-hung-jury.html">hush-money trial</a>, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-second-term-agenda.html">Donald Trump</a> had had no shortage of support from people in the former category — if you can call sycophants like Speaker <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-speaker-mike-johnson-court-09aef3de395fa77843f2600f40da6ac3">Mike Johnson</a>; representatives <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-sleeping-excuses.html">Lauren Boebert</a> and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/matt-gaetz-proud-boys-trump-hush-money-trial.html">Matt Gaetz</a>; a host of people on <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-vp-pick-2024-candidates-odds.html">Trump’s VP shortlist</a>; and Andrew Giuliani, son of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/rudy-giuliani-where-trump-former-attorney-today.html">Rudy Giuliani</a>, “friends.” But mustering close family members proved to be a bigger challenge for the former president. While three of Trump’s five children eventually put in an appearance at the Manhattan criminal courthouse <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ivanka-trump-pac-legal-fees.html">Ivanka Trump</a> and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/melania-trump-back-missing-again.html">Melania Trump</a> didn’t appear once. When the jury <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">found Trump guilty on all counts</a> on Thursday only Eric Trump was in the courtroom with his father.</p><p>Eric was the “only one of the ex-president’s children who has been regularly present during the trial,” as <em>Forbes</em> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/05/28/don-jr-tiffany-trump-attend-hush-money-trial-closing-arguments-as-melania-and-ivanka-avoid-it/?sh=681079206dcd">reported</a>. He was sometimes joined by his wife, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/election-deniers-lara-trump-michael-whatley-to-lead-rnc-republican-national-committee.html">Lara Trump</a>, who recently became co-chair of the Republican National Committee.</p><p>Don Jr. has been recovering from knee surgery, so he’s had a good excuse for not appearing in court. But he still <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1792906679069065416">posted</a> frequent social-media laments about the trial and managed to make it to court twice, once last week and again on Tuesday for closing arguments. After his second appearance, he made an impassioned speech outside the courthouse, claiming his father is the victim of a “witch hunt”:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If there was ever any doubt that this was a political persecution, the fact that the Biden campaign would hold a rally outside of the courthouse during closing arguments tells you everything you needed to know. <br><br>Election interference!!!  <a href="https://t.co/cGaMU2ld3h">pic.twitter.com/cGaMU2ld3h</a></p>&mdash; Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1795511445901226343?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Eric, Lara, and Don Jr. were joined on Tuesday by Tiffany Trump, along with her husband, Michael Boulos. But rather than creating an image of a unified Trump clan, the appearance of Donald Trump’s rarely seen youngest daughter only drew attention to who was absent. A reporter actually shouted “Where’s Melania?” as Trump headed into court in front of his children.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As Tiffany Trump, Eric Trump, Lara Trump and Don Jr stand behind Donald Trump at the courthouse today, reporter shouts the obvious question: “Where’s Melania?” <a href="https://t.co/znsESEXOGi">pic.twitter.com/znsESEXOGi</a></p>&mdash; Mike Sington (@MikeSington) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSington/status/1795477235966914777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The answer is “wherever Melania was when she shunned all of Trump’s other court appearances.” While the former First Lady has appeared at a few <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/melania-trump-back-missing-again.html">private fundraisers</a> in recent months, she has skipped all of her husband’s public political events and court appearances for more than a year. (Their son, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-barron-graduation-fundraiser.html">Barron</a>, who just graduated from high school, has never played an active role in his father’s political career.) Melania’s <a href="https://truthsocial.com/">Truth Social page</a> is devoted exclusively to anodyne holiday greetings and hawking <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/melania-trump-mothers-day-selling-necklace.html">ugly jewelry</a>. The chances of her showing up at a trial that centers on her husband allegedly cheating on her with a porn star were always slim to none.</p><p>The same goes for Ivanka. At the start of the 2024 campaign, Trump’s daughter and former White House adviser <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ivanka-trump-pac-legal-fees.html">announced</a>: “I do not plan to be involved in politics. While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena.” Ivanka didn’t even bother to keep a low profile as her father’s criminal trial came to a close. This week, she posted photos and videos on Instagram showing her vacationing in Las Vegas with her family and catching an Adele concert with her 12-year-old daughter and some friends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ivanka Trump attended <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeekendsWithAdele?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WeekendsWithAdele</a> this past weekend alongside her daughter.<br><br>“Best night seeing the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/Adele?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Adele</a> perform in Las Vegas” <a href="https://t.co/Awpi7KeHob">pic.twitter.com/Awpi7KeHob</a></p>&mdash; Adeles News (@Adelesnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/Adelesnews/status/1795687218851504451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>When the jury delivered a verdict on Thursday, Ivanka’s Instagram Stories featured a slow-motion video of her son swinging a golf club to the Eagles “Take It Easy.” Melania remained silent on her social media feeds.</p><figure>

      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Day 23: Trump Found Guilty of All Charges</strong></p><p><strong>34 for 34</strong></p><p>After 11 hours of deliberation, a Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 charges of falsifying business records in the first degree, making him the first president in American history to be convicted of a crime.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged that Trump altered financial records in order to hide the paper trail from a payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence on a purported affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has long denied Daniels’s allegations. The verdict wraps up a legal process that began in April 2023 when Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg unveiled a <a href="https://manhattanda.org/district-attorney-bragg-announces-34-count-felony-indictment-of-former-president-donald-j-trump/">34-count indictment</a> of Trump, the first of the four cases filed against him that year.</p><p><strong>Verdict reached</strong></p><p>Judge Merchan announced that the jury has reached a verdict and that they’ve requested 30 minutes to fill out the relevant paperwork. The mood in the room is reportedly tense.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Keep the outbursts to a minimum, and stay in your seats afterwards until you&#39;re given further instructions,&quot; a court officer tells us.<br><br>It is tense.<br><br>Trump, amazingly, has closed his eyes.</p>&mdash; Tyler McBrien (@TylerMcBrien) <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1796283300773851439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Trump scrolls social media as he awaits verdict</strong></p><p>Trump is required to remain in the courthouse as the jury deliberates. Consequently, he’s been far more active on Truth Social, complaining about the case as a verdict draws nearer. In <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112530748938756729">one post</a>, Trump wrote: “Can anybody believe that our Government would be spending Tens of Millions of Taxpayer Dollars on prosecuting this RIDICULOUS Case? I DID NOTHING WRONG! IN FACT, I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT. The testimony in Court was amazing for the Defense!”</p><p><strong>Jury resumes deliberations</strong></p><p>By mid-morning, the jury returned to its deliberations after re-hearing the four areas of testimony they had asked for, as well as part of Merchan’s initial instructions to them.</p><p><strong>More requests from the jury</strong></p><p>Judge Merchan announced that there was a new note from the jury, specifying a section of jury instructions that they wished to hear again. (The jury had initially indicated on Wednesday that they wanted to hear jury instructions a second time.) The jury also requested headphones, suggesting that the members intend to replay some of the audio recordings entered as evidence.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HAPPENING NOW: The jury says it wants Merchan to begin the instructions with the part about how they are supposed to consider the evidence and draw inferences -- including the metaphor about how if the ground is wet in the AM, you can infer it rained over night.</p>&mdash; Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1796174872931930340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Merchan began Thursday by re-reading sections of the <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFS/press/PDFs/People%20v.%20DJT%20Jury%20Instructions%20and%20Charges%20FINAL%205-23-24.pdf">instructions</a> he first gave Wednesday morning. After that, two court reporters began to read back the portions of testimony requested by the jury. In one of the exchanges read, Trump, in conversation with ex-publisher David Pecker, said, “I spoke to Michael. Karen is a nice girl,” in reference to Michael Cohen and model Karen McDougal.</p><p><strong>The possible outcomes</strong></p><p>As the jury continues to discuss the case, there are four possible outcomes they could reach. The 12 members must all be unanimous in their decision.</p><p>• Conviction on all counts: The jury could find that Trump is guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records.</p><p>• Conviction on some counts, acquittal on others: In a more mixed scenario, the jurors could find that Trump was guilty on some of the charges but not others.</p><p>• Acquittal on all counts: Trump could be found not guilty on all 34 charges against him.</p><p>• A hung jury: If all 12 jurors are unable to come to an agreement on a verdict, they’ll be a hung jury. Judge Merchan could then issue what’s known as an Allen charge, which are instructions urging the jury to continue deliberations and to try to reach a consensus. If the jury members are still at an impasse after that, Merchan would be forced to declare a mistrial.</p><p><strong>All eyes on the jury</strong></p><p><em>New York</em>’s Andrew Rice, who has covered the trial from day one, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-jury-deliberation.html">writes </a>about how courtroom observers have tried to read the 12 men and women assigned to determine Trump’s fate:</p><blockquote><p>Through the weeks of lurid testimony, and dustups between the defense and the judge, and the contempt citations, and special guest appearances by vice-presidential hopefuls, the jurors sat there like birds on branches. Their names are being withheld from the public in order to protect them from the harassment — or worse — that could come at them as a result of their decision, but watching them in the courtroom day after day, you could observe their plumage. Juror 1, the foreman, who favors tight T-shirts and has a face that sits in a resting smirk; Juror 3, a young lawyer with structured hair, who tried to grow a beard for a while and then gave up; Juror 12, an Upper East Side woman, who wore a white shirt and sweater for closing arguments. A suffragette signal, or was it seasonally appropriate for the day after Memorial Day? Looking through the binoculars, a birdwatcher can’t tell you what the birds are thinking. But you can try to surmise the direction they’re migrating.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Day 22: The Jury Deliberates</strong></p><p>On Wednesday, the 12 men and women of the jury began their deliberations on whether to convict a former U.S. president.</p><p><strong>Two notes from the jury</strong></p><p>The jury issued a note to the court after deliberating for three hours, making four requests related to past testimony. They asked for Pecker’s testimony on the Trump Tower meeting between himself, Trump, and Cohen; Pecker’s testimony regarding the funding of the “catch and kill” deal he struck with Karen McDougal; and Pecker’s remarks about a phone call he had with Trump. The jurors also requested Cohen’s testimony regarding the Trump Tower meeting. On Thursday, the jury will be brought back into the courtroom so the specific pieces of testimony can be read to them.</p><p>Harry Litman, a former U.S. Attorney and deputy assistant attorney general, said on social media that the jury’s request regarding the Pecker-Trump phone call appears bad for the defense.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone call w/ Trump and Pecker is about McDougal where Trump says nice girl and Pecker says he thought they had had an affair.  Bad augury for Trump that they&#39;re asking for that.</p>&mdash; Harry Litman (@harrylitman) <a href="https://twitter.com/harrylitman/status/1795905837581369538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The jury also entered a second note, asking for the jury instructions to be reread to them. The jurors were not given a copy of the instructions, which is typical in New York State courts. As the attorneys pored over the transcripts to find the relevant sections of testimony to be read, Judge Merchan dismissed the jury for the day until 9:30 a.m. on Thursday.</p><p><strong>The jury has it from here</strong></p><p>The men and women of the jury officially began their deliberations just before 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday. They must rule unanimously on whether to convict or acquit Trump. The former president and his legal team are required to stay in the courthouse during deliberations. The jury is slated to discuss the case until 4:30 p.m. today, and additional time will be added as needed.</p><p><strong>Merchan instructs the jury</strong></p><p>Merchan’s jury instructions lasted an hour. The judge advised that jurors are not to make decisions based on biases or stereotypes and that they should set aside any personal opinions they have of the defendant. “It is not my responsibility to judge the evidence here,” he said. “It is yours. You are the judges of the facts, and you are responsible for deciding whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.”</p><p>Merchan informed the jury members that they cannot hold against Trump his decision not to testify, saying the burden of proof is on the prosecution and not the defendant. The judge went through all 34 charges and instructed the jury on the law behind falsifying business records.</p><p><strong>You talkin’ to me?</strong></p><p>On Truth Social, Trump took aim at Robert De Niro a day after the frequent Trump critic gave remarks outside the courthouse. During his appearance, De Niro denounced Trump as a tyrant.</p><p>In the post, Trump called the Oscar-winning actor “wacko” and “pathetic” and seemed to refer to the Simon & Garfunkel song “Mrs. Robinson,” prompting questions as to whether he had mixed up De Niro with Dustin Hoffman, who actually starred in <em>The Graduate</em>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wait a minute -- does Trump think Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman are the same guy? <a href="https://t.co/Ec7hCr3JDr">pic.twitter.com/Ec7hCr3JDr</a></p>&mdash; Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1795802127605932051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Day 21: Closing Arguments</strong></p><p>On Tuesday, after a long-weekend break, the prosecution and the defense presented their closing statements to the jury well into the evening.</p><p><strong>Court after hours</strong></p><p>True to his earlier estimate, Steinglass’s closing argument lasted for a little less than five hours, pushing the proceedings beyond its usual 4:30 p.m. end time into the evening. Before court broke at 8 p.m., the prosecutor summed up the alleged plot. “The name of the game was concealment, and all roads lead inescapably to the man that benefited the most, the defendant, former president Donald J. Trump,” Steinglass said.</p><p><strong>More from the prosecution</strong></p><p>Joshua Steinglass walked through the Trump campaign’s response to the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape, reminding the jury of a series of text messages between Cohen, David Pecker, and staffers like Hope Hicks and Steve Bannon, in which the parties reacted frantically to the tape’s release. He reiterated his office’s argument that the tape, which Trump referred to as “locker-room talk,” was the motivation behind allegedly paying off Daniels. “Stormy Daniels was a walking, talking reminder that the defendant was not only words,” Steinglass said. “She would have totally undermined his strategy for spinning the <em>Access Hollywood </em>tape.”</p><p>The prosecutor guided the jury through the timeline of the payment negotiations, supporting the narrative with Cohen’s call logs.  Steinglass pointed out that Cohen spoke to Trump twice on October 26, 2016. The following day, Cohen would set up the bank account he used to wire the $130,000 to Daniels’s lawyer, a fact Steinglass called “damning.” Steinglass also took aim at the defense’s argument that Trump’s concern about Daniels’s allegations was about his family, not his electoral chances. “It’s no coincidence that the sex happened in 2006 but the payoff didn’t happen until October 2016, two weeks before the election. That’s because the defendant’s primary concern was not his family, but the election,” he <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/trump-hush-money-trial/?id=110586765#110622826">said</a>.</p><p><strong>On Michael Cohen</strong></p><p>Steinglass then focused on Cohen, the main target of Blanche’s closing argument. The prosecutor admitted that Cohen did make money off his employment with Trump as well as his break from his former boss, but pointed out that the ex-lawyer was the only one in the scheme to go to jail for his involvement. “I’m not asking you to feel bad for Michael Cohen. He made his bed, but you can hardly blame him for making money on the one thing he has left, which is his knowledge of the Trump phenomenon,” Steinglass said.</p><p>In one notable moment, Steinglass tackled an argument from the defense that claimed an alleged short phone call between Cohen and Trump on his bodyguard Keith Schiller’s phone was actually Cohen being harassed by a prank caller, rather than a conversation about the Daniels payment. Per observers in the room, Steinglass acted out a fake phone call between Trump and Cohen, making the point that the call could’ve covered a lot of ground in a short span of time.</p><p>Steinglass didn’t dispute that Cohen was an imperfect witness. “We didn’t choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn’t pick him up at the witness store,” Steinglass said. “The defendant chose Michael Cohen as his fixer because he was willing to lie and cheat on his behalf.”</p><p>The prosecutor characterized the defense’s focus on Cohen as a distraction. “This case is not about Michael Cohen; this case is about Donald Trump and whether he should be held accountable,” Steinglass said.</p><p><strong>The prosecution’s turn</strong></p><p>When court returned from a lunch break, Merchan instructed the jury to disregard Blanche’s earlier comment about sending Trump to prison, calling it “improper.” Steinglass then gave the prosecution’s closing arguments. He reminded the jury that his fellow prosecutor Matthew Colangelo had opened the trial by alleging “a conspiracy and a cover-up.” Steinglass went headfirst at the defense’s claims, specifically Blanche’s allegation that Stormy Daniels was attempting to extort Trump over a false story. He said that Daniels’s testimony was credible, even if some of the more explicit details of her encounter with Trump were “cringeworthy.” Steinglass asked why the defense tried so hard to discredit Daniels if her story was unimportant. “In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive,” he said.</p><p>Steinglass pointed out that many of the prosecution’s witnesses were friends or employees of Trump, and recounted their positive relationships and interactions with him. He said Pecker, who knew Trump for decades, had no reason to lie. “He still considers Donald Trump a friend and mentor, and still his testimony is utterly devastating,” Steinglass said.</p><p><strong>Lunch break</strong></p><p>Observers spotted men carrying several bags of McDonald’s, a known favorite of Trump’s, into the courthouse during the afternoon lunch break. A <em>Politico</em> reporter asked if the order was for the former president and his team, and received minimal response:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spotted outside 100 Centre at lunch break: men in suits carrying lots of McDonald’s bags. Asked if that was for Trump, one of them said: “I don’t know.” <a href="https://t.co/JAbceBEY9B">pic.twitter.com/JAbceBEY9B</a></p>&mdash; Ben Feuerherd (@benfeuerherd) <a href="https://twitter.com/benfeuerherd/status/1795501089720074448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Merchan scolds Blanche</strong></p><p>At the end of his closing argument, Blanche told the jury that they couldn’t send someone to prison on Cohen’s word. The prosecution objected, and Judge Merchan sustained the objection. After the jury’s dismissal for lunch, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass called Blanche’s comment “wholly inappropriate” and asked Merchan to address it with the jury.</p><p>Merchan agreed and proceeded to dress Blanche down for his remark, which he called outrageous. “You know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It simply not allowed. Period. It’s hard for me to imagine that was accidental in any way,” he said, per <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-28-24/h_a4f07ac368fa84106c06744791f49d1a">CNN</a>. He will likely bring up the matter with the jury after they return from break.</p><p><strong>Blanche: Cohen is the MVP of liars</strong></p><p>As his argument neared its end, Blanche once again took time to cast doubt on Cohen’s integrity, reminding the jury that he has lied under oath, to the Federal Election Commission and even to his family. “He’s literally like an MVP of liars,” Blanche said. He listed ten reasons that the jury should have reasonable doubt, including the fact that Cohen created the invoices named in the charges and model Karen McDougal’s reluctance to tell her story. But Blanche’s tenth and final reason was Cohen himself, who he called the “human embodiment of reasonable doubt.”</p><p>“Michael Cohen is the GLOAT,” he said, referring to the ex-lawyer as the “Greatest Liar of All Time.”</p><p><strong>On Stormy Daniels and <em>Access Hollywood</em></strong></p><p>Blanche pushed back on prosecutors’ characterizations of the Trump campaign’s reaction to the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape, arguing that it wasn’t a “doomsday event,” but that Trump was concerned about his family’s potential involvement in the story. The prosecution has argued that the tape was a motivating factor in Trump’s alleged payoff to adult film star Stormy Daniels in order to suppress her story.</p><p>Blanche repeated Trump’s claim that the affair Daniels alleges never occurred. He suggested that Daniels, along with her manager Gina Rodriguez and <em>Enquirer</em> editor-in-chief Dylan Howard, sought to exploit Trump financially. “This started out as an extortion, there’s no doubt about that, and it ended very well for Ms. Daniels, financially speaking,” Blanche said.</p><p>Blanche also took a shot at prosecutors’ decision to have Daniels testify, asking the jury why they did so.</p><p>“I’ll tell you why,” Blanche said. “They did it to try to inflame your emotions, they did it to try to embarrass President Trump,” Blanche said. The prosecution objected, and Judge Merchan sustained the objection.</p><p><strong>More from Blanche</strong></p><p>Blanche noted that Cohen’s testimony mentioned several key people who were ultimately not called to testify, among them former Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg, former <em>National Enquirer </em>editor-in-chief Dylan Howard, and Keith Schiller, Trump’s former bodyguard. Blanche also mentioned that the first two checks to Cohen were signed by Weisselberg and Trump’s sons, Don Jr. and Eric, rather than by Trump, and pointed out that the prosecution hadn’t called them to testify, either.</p><p>Blanche downplayed the prosecution’s argument that there was a conspiracy to hide unsavory information in order to get Trump elected. “It doesn’t matter if there was a conspiracy to try to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate,” Blanche <a href="https://x.com/juliareinstein/status/1795466035350376900">said</a>.</p><p>On the much-discussed 2015 Trump Tower meeting between Trump, Cohen, and American Media, Inc CEO David Pecker, Blanche suggested it was standard practice. He said the relationship between AMI and Trump to publish positive stories was mutually beneficial and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-28-24/h_95d26a7cc8c0011e1e191a7bb93fca2d">said</a> that it was “preposterous” that the two men would think that the <em>National Enquirer</em> could sway an election.</p><p><strong>De Niro takes on Trump</strong></p><p>The Biden campaign held a press conference outside the lower Manhattan courthouse Tuesday morning, the first time it has actively waded into discussion about Trump’s ongoing trial. Actor Robert De Niro, who recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiwJ3kTMX60&t=1s">narrated an ad</a> for the campaign, gave remarks to the assembled media.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Robert De Niro: Donald Trump doesn’t belong in my city. We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot. A two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids. He’s a clown.

<p>The frequent Trump critic was accompanied by Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, two police officers well-known for their roles guarding the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. “Donald Trump wants to destroy, not only this city, but the country, and eventually, he could destroy the world,” De Niro said.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“F— you!” “You’re a p—!” “Go home!” “DeNiro, we hate you!” — that’s what DeNiro hears as he speaks, Trump supporters screaming at him from nearby park.

<p><strong>The defense speaks</strong></p><p>Todd Blanche opened the defense’s closing statement by thanking the jury for their time and attentiveness. He then echoed the remarks he made when the trial began, arguing that Donald Trump had not broken the law. “He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof — period,” Blanche <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-28-24/h_1bccc9a88d75ee933a04d6eb19e050e5">said</a>. The former prosecutor’s argument focused significantly on the credibility of Michael Cohen, the prosecution’s key witness.

<p><strong>Day 20: The Defense Rests</strong></p><p>On Tuesday, the prosecution continued its cross-examination of lawyer Robert Costello, who turned out to be the trial’s final witness.</p><p><strong>A debate over words</strong></p><p>Although the jury was excused earlier in the day, Judge Merchan and the attorneys for both sides returned to the court that afternoon for the important but often dry work of hashing out jury instructions. Even though seemingly tedious, the wording of the charging instructions can have significant implications for both the prosecution and the defense as the jury considers its verdict. In a <a href="https://x.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1792992946326737093">light moment</a>, Merchan joked about removing the word <em>eleemosynary</em>, spelling it for the court after he said he couldn’t pronounce it. Trump lawyer Emil Bove and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo both laughed, and the word was dropped without objection.</p><p>Bove argued that Merchan should tell the jury that hush-money payments aren’t illegal. Colangelo disagreed, asserting that such an instruction would amount to the judge making the defense team’s arguments for it. Merchan ultimately sided with the prosecution. “I think that to take it to the next level and actually give an instruction to the bench is taking it too far. I don’t think it’s necessary,” he said, per <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-21-24/h_be9e1cacbe92e34f7df4a77edf86c354">CNN</a>.</p><p>Merchan said he will try to get final instructions to both sides by the end of the day on Thursday.</p><p><strong>Trump complains about gag order … again</strong></p><p>Trump, once again, made comments to the media when he returned to the courtroom Tuesday afternoon for a discussion on jury instructions.

In my opinion, this is the clear correct strategy.” When asked by Hoffinger what he meant, Costello said he was referring to getting everyone “on the same page.” Costello testified that he had no animosity toward Cohen. Hoffinger then asked if his recent testimony to Congress, in which he denounced Cohen as a liar, was his attempt to intimidate Cohen. “Intimidate Cohen?

<p><strong>Day 19: The Prosecution Rests</strong></p><p><strong>A bang, then a whimper</strong></p><p>After those brief fireworks, the defense’s remaining line of questioning was fairly calm. Trump attorney Emil Bove showed an email between Costello and Cohen in which Costello said he would pass along a message to Rudy Giuliani. Costello said he never pressured Cohen to do anything. He said he considered Cohen a client and was only concerned with his best interests.</p><p>Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger cross-examined Costello for the defense, asking him if landing Cohen as a client would’ve been a big deal for him. “I didn’t know Michael Cohen from a hole in the wall,” he said. Hoffinger then asked, “So you weren’t hoping to represent Michael Cohen?” Costello said “no.” Hoffinger then raised an email from Costello’s son congratulating him on getting Cohen as a client. According to those in the room, the jury was watching closely as Costello frequently corrected Hoffinger’s questions. At one point, he<a href="https://x.com/eorden/status/1792654653152170339"> told her</a> to “speak into the microphone, please.” The jury was excused with the prosecution’s cross-examination expected to continue on Tuesday.</p><p>Before court adjourned for the day, Trump attorney Todd Blanche requested a dismissal of the case, saying that Cohen is not credible. Merchan, who said he would reserve his decision, asked of Blanche, “You said that his lies were irrefutable, but you think he’s going to fool 12 New Yorkers into believing this lie?” in reference to the jury.</p><p><strong>Judge Merchan scolds witness</strong></p><p>According to observers in the room, Costello seemed frustrated by the multiple sustained objections and could be heard muttering “ridiculous” into the mic, per <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-20-24/h_740ac103bf3c6de1b6d2259495c4a1cc">CNN</a>. In one moment, Costello said “jeez” after another sustained objection from Merchan, prompting the judge to look at Costello sharply and say, “I’m sorry?” Costello then asked for his comment to be struck from the record.</p><p>It was then that things grew chaotic. Merchan asked the jury to leave the room while asking Costello to remain seated. The judge then scolded Costello for his outbursts, saying he wanted to discuss “proper decorum” in his courtroom. “If you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘Strike it,’ because I’m the only one who can strike testimony in court,” Merchan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/20/nyregion/trump-trial-hush-money/1ce5fd34-5736-56d5-9322-9c7dcfa544a7?smid=url-share">said</a>. He added, “You don’t give me side-eye, and you don’t roll your eyes.” Costello glared at the judge, <a href="https://x.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1792647691786223919">causing</a> Merchan to ask, “Are you staring me down right now?” He then called for the courtroom to be cleared with the press briefly ordered out of the room. After a moment, the gallery was allowed back into the courtroom and the jury was called back.</p><p><strong>The defense calls Robert Costello</strong></p><p>Blanche briefly questioned Daniel Sitko, a paralegal at his law firm, over a chat submitted into evidence showing 75 phone calls between Cohen and Costello. Blanche then called Costello himself to the stand. Immediately, the prosecution called for a sidebar, and the jury was excused as the two sides discussed the scope of the questions Costello could be asked. Merchan left the courtroom briefly to consider the issue and returned, allowing Costello to be questioned but with some restrictions, saying he did not want this to become “a trial within the trial.”</p><p>Bove began his questioning of Costello, asking about his first meeting with Cohen in the Regency Hotel after he was subjected to an FBI raid in 2018. Costello described Cohen as being “absolutely manic,” pacing back and forth. The prosecution objected several times to Bove’s line of questions, many of which were sustained by Merchan. Costello testified that Cohen said “numerous times” that Trump wasn’t aware of the payment to Daniels.</p><p><strong>A picture’s worth a thousand words</strong></p><p>Before the court broke for lunch, the prosecution asked to submit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/20/nyregion/trump-trial-hush-money/d289f397-6baf-501c-852f-d93c191d4448?smid=url-share">newly discovered photos</a> into evidence: shots of Trump with his bodyguard Keith Schiller on October 24, 2016, at around the time that Cohen has alleged that he called Trump on Schiller’s phone. The photos, which were at a rally, were drawn from C-SPAN’s archives. The defense has attempted to call that phone conversation into question. Merchan took the lunch break to revisit the testimony from the C-SPAN archivist who spoke earlier in the trial and asked the prosecution for a timeline for the witness to potentially return to court.</p><p>After a brief break, the prosecution said it reached C-SPAN, which was in the process of booking travel for Robert Browning, the executive director of C-SPAN’s archives, to return to New York to testify tomorrow. In the end, that proved to be unnecessary: The defense and the prosecution came to an agreement to admit the photo without the need for the witness’s return. When Cohen returned to the stand, Hoffinger asked him to identify the figures in the photo. It’s a still taken from a video of a Trump rally in Tampa, Florida. Cohen identified both Trump and Schiller.</p><p>During a brief re-cross-examination from the defense, Blanche asked Cohen about his license to practice law. “You lost your law license.

<p><strong>A redirect</strong></p><p>Hoffinger rose to requestion Cohen, taking aim at the defense’s arguments. She asked Cohen about his busy schedule during the time of the Daniels payment, asking if he was usually busy. He said “yes.” Hoffinger asked directly if Cohen was too busy to finalize the payment and to get Trump’s approval. “No, ma’am,” he responded.</p><p>Cohen also had an opportunity to expand upon his interaction with RedFinch, explaining that he used the firm to boost Trump’s numbers in online polls. He said he kept the additional $30,000 that he overbilled Trump for in response to the lower bonus he received from the Trump Organization. “I was angered because of the reduction of the bonus,” he <a href="https://x.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1792588303893455154">said</a>.</p><p>Cohen acknowledged that his letter to the FEC as well as the 2018 letter signed by Daniels denying the affair were intentionally misleading and agreed that Trump knew of the substance of these statements and approved. Hoffinger asked about a line in the FEC letter that claimed that the payment “does not constitute a campaign contribution.” When asked if that was a true statement, Cohen responded, “No, ma’am.”</p><p><strong>Cohen on loyalty</strong></p><p>Before wrapping up his cross-examination, Blanche asked if Cohen had a financial interest in the case. Cohen said he did but denied that Trump being convicted would benefit him personally. “It’s better if he’s not, for me, because it gives me more to talk about in the future,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-20-24/h_5c22f3030375e3f8de56ff390f45a18d">said</a>, referring to his TikTok account and podcasts.</p><p>In a final exchange, Blanche asked Cohen if it was true that he would lie out of loyalty, pointing to Cohen’s past testimony in which he said he had lied to Congress out of loyalty to Trump. “Yes, sir,” he <a href="https://x.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1792585117405216871">replied</a>.</p><p><strong>Fatigue setting in</strong></p><p>With the trial entering its sixth week, weariness levels are going up.

<p><strong>More Cohen cross-examination</strong></p><p>Blanche asked Cohen about legalwork he performed for Trump in 2017, a way for the defense to suggest that payments Trump made to Cohen were legitimate. Cohen <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1792565355153350895">confirmed </a>that he did work for Melania Trump, including trademark negotiations with the wax museum Madame Tussauds. Cohen said he also did consulting work for AT&T after meeting the CEO through Trump.</p><p>Blanche asked Cohen if he had informed others at the time that Trump knew nothing about the Stormy Daniels payment at the center of the trial. Cohen said “yes,” noting that he said as much in interviews with reporters.</p><p><strong>Cohen admits to theft</strong></p><p>Blanche asked Cohen about RedFinch, a tech company whose services he used during his time working for Trump. Cohen admitted that he paid the company only $20,000 but asked to be reimbursed by the Trump Organization for $50,000. That number was part of the $420,000 figure that Cohen was ultimately repaid, including the Daniels payment. “You stole from the Trump Organization, right?” Blanche asked. “Yes, sir,” Cohen replied.</p><p><strong>Cohen returns</strong></p><p>Blanche continued his cross-examination of Cohen by asking the ex-fixer if he had spoken to any reporters since he took the stand last week. Cohen said he had but that he didn’t discuss his testimony. As he did last week, Blanche then jumped between subjects, asking Cohen about his congressional testimony and his taxi-medallion business.</p><p>Eventually, he turned to the timeline of the Daniels payment, pointing out that Cohen was juggling a lot in October 2016: There were issues with Cohen’s taxi medallions, he was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-20-24/h_36cfdc74668568c5fa0e15de7c01e01f">helping </a>Tiffany Trump with an extortion lawsuit, and he was trying to secure an endorsement for Trump from a relative of Martin Luther King Jr. Cohen made two phone calls to Trump on October 26, 2016, the day the Daniels payment was made. Blanche asked if he spoke to Trump about these other subjects instead of Daniels. Cohen stuck to his story: “My recollection is that I was speaking to him about Stormy Daniels because that was what he tasked me to take care of,” Cohen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/20/nyregion/trump-trial-hush-money/236369da-a23b-5208-b200-e54e8d46b494?smid=url-share">testified</a>.</p><p><strong>Discussions on a possible expert witness</strong></p><p>Court reconvened earlier than usual to allow for discussions about possible evidence and witnesses. Merchan declined the defense’s request to enter an email between Cohen and Costello into evidence. The judge also narrowed the scope regarding an expert witness for the defense: former FEC commissioner Brad Smith. Citing his previous rulings and a similar decision from the judge in the Sam Bankman-Fried case, Merchan <a href="https://x.com/hugolowell/status/1792542247646298512">ruled</a> that Smith can testify about what the FEC is and define general terms but is barred from giving his interpretation of specific statutes.</p><p><strong>End in sight</strong></p><p>Last week, Judge Merchan urged both sides to prepare for closing statements over the next few days. But on Monday, the judge said summations will likely take place <em>next </em>Tuesday, following the Memorial Day holiday. “It was either have a long break now or have a long break then, and unfortunately the calendar is what it is,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/20/nyregion/trump-trial-hush-money/5cc76ad1-e34c-5e3e-a045-1d68c99660a4?smid=url-share">said</a>.</p><p>With the defense expected to finish its cross-examination of Cohen on Monday, Trump’s legal team will have the opportunity to present its own witnesses if it so chooses.

Blanche asked if Cohen recalled saying that Daniels and her legal team were “extorting” Trump. Cohen said he did. Blanche moved on to the nondisclosure agreement signed by Daniels, asking Cohen if this was a “completely legal binding contract.” He <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1791190421726531891">responded</a>, “Yes, sir.”</p><p>Cohen was then asked if he had a retainer agreement for his work for the Trump Organization or any legalwork he did for the Trumps personally.

<p><strong>The art of recording conversations</strong></p><p>Blanche, who has made a habit of switching his line of questioning frequently, turned back to Cohen’s relationship with the media following the lunch break. Cohen confirmed that he would work to make sure there were positive stories about Trump in the media. Cohen said he would consult with Trump about stories out of concern that he would “blow up” at him if not. He admitted to secretly recording phone conversations he had with reporters, something that is legal under New York’s one-party consent law, but said he stopped doing that following the 2016 election. Cohen acknowledged having recorded Trump while he represented him — which Blanche jumped on. “You understand that it is not ethical for a lawyer to record a conversation with their client,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-16-24/h_dc0324506a742e39c414b5d30e53c087">asked</a>. Cohen agreed but noted the crime-fraud exception.</p><p>Blanche continued to ask about the September 2016 recording of Trump, purportedly about the Karen McDougal deal, that was previously played for the court. He suggested that when Trump said “pay in cash” that he could’ve been referring to a deal with no financing rather than literal cash.</p><p><strong>Questions about a conversation</strong></p><p>By 12:30 p.m., Blanche finally somewhat broached the subject of the payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels. He asked Cohen about a phone call that he testified about between him and Trump regarding the resolution of the Daniels deal through Trump’s bodyguard Keith Schiller’s phone. Blanche tried to cast doubt on the call, implying that he never raised it before. He even tried to suggest that the call was about a 14-year-old prank caller who had been harassing Cohen.</p><p><strong>Cohen on his post-2016-election prospects</strong></p><p>Blanche picked up a line of questioning first raised by the prosecution: whether Cohen wanted to work in the White House following Trump’s election. Previously, Cohen said he didn’t want to work in Washington, but rather simply wanted to be considered for a role as a boost to his ego. Blanche attempted to poke holes in that testimony, raising texts between Cohen and his daughter where Cohen discussed possibly being chief of staff. Cohen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/16/nyregion/trump-trial-cohen-hush-money/dff05d1d-e36a-59da-a27a-134d5033b923?smid=url-share">insisted</a> that he always wanted to be personal attorney to the president, a hybrid role outside of the White House that would give him access to Trump.</p><p>Cohen was asked about his trouble getting inauguration tickets and whether he agreed with his daughter’s sentiment in a text that Trump’s people were “walking all over you.” He said he agreed with her at the time.</p><p>Blanche asked, “But you were disappointed that after all the work that you had done for President Trump for nine and a half years, nobody — including President Trump — offered you a position in the White House?”</p><p>Cohen <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-16-24/h_9d67ae4e777ee5537f4df315fd3da6cb">responded</a>, “That’s not accurate.”</p><p><strong>Cohen confronted with past lies</strong></p><p>The defense has sought to cast doubt on Cohen’s reliability as a witness by raising lies that he’s told in the past. Cohen was asked about his previous lies under oath, falsehoods that he testified earlier were for Trump’s benefit. He confirmed that he lied during his past testimony to Congress. Blanche questioned Cohen about his 2018 charges for tax evasion, asking about past comments where he called the counts “bogus.” Cohen maintained that he felt he shouldn’t have been charged and that he only pleaded guilty to protect his family.</p><p>When Blanche asked if Cohen lied to a federal judge because “the stakes affected you personally,” Cohen admitted that was true. Blanche asked Cohen about the various people he’s blamed for his convictions, including judges, his accountant, and even federal prosecutors. Cohen <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-16-24/h_6e01574f120720cf47916ec0d70fa6ec">agreed </a>that he had. Blanche questioned Cohen about a past claim that he had never asked Trump for a pardon and wouldn’t have accepted one. “I never asked for it,” Cohen <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1791125264342163475">said</a>, adding that he asked his lawyer about it after hearing Trump talk about pre-pardoning on TV. Cohen said a pardon had been “dangled” and admitted that he had his legal team explore that option. “I wanted this nightmare to end,” he said.</p><p><strong>Cohen vs. Blanche: round two</strong></p><p>Blanche picked up his cross-examination where he left off on Tuesday. Blanche began by asking Cohen about his interactions with Jeremy Rosenberg, a former investigator with the district attorney’s office. The defense attempted to ask about a series of texts between the two, but they weren’t allowed in after Judge Merchan sustained an objection from the prosecution. Blanche asked if Cohen learned of Trump’s indictment in this case from Rosenberg. The ex-fixer denied this, saying that he learned about it in the New York <em>Times</em>.</p><p>Blanche then played clips of Cohen’s <em>Mea Culpa</em> podcast for the court that featured Cohen’s trademark loud and brash-sounding voice, a stark contrast from the calm and controlled tone he’s used while testifying. In the clips, Cohen can be heard celebrating Trump’s indictment, saying, “I truly f–king hope that this man ends up in prison” and “… Revenge is a dish best served cold and you better believe I want this man to go down and rot inside for what he did to my family.” Cohen acknowledged that he continued to insult Trump and comment on the trial despite having his social media monitored by the district attorney’s office.</p><p><strong>Trump’s lawyers continue gag-order fight</strong></p><p>Trump’s legal team has filed an appeal to New York’s highest court over its fight to overturn or modify the gag order placed on him.

<p>Before court wrapped up for the day, Cohen disclosed under questioning that he had made about $3.4 million over the past four years for two books he wrote about Trump, <em>Disloyal</em> and <em>Revenge</em>.</p><p><strong>Trump nap watch</strong></p><p>The most anticipated cross-examination of the trial is not enough to keep Trump’s attention, apparently. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/14/nyregion/trump-trial-news-michael-cohen/fae91665-8c4d-5807-a6e9-fd1ca546401e?smid=url-share"><em>Times</em></a> notes that Trump “has dropped his head repeatedly and appears to be struggling to stay awake” as his team questions Cohen. This is <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-asleep-hush-money-trial.html">far from the first time</a> he has nodded off.</p><p><strong>Blanche enters the ring</strong></p><p>After the court returned from lunch, Todd Blanche rose to begin the defense’s cross-examination of Cohen. Blanche’s questioning started with a bang as he asked Cohen if they had ever met before. When Cohen said no, Blanche <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1790446719584309615">said</a> that Cohen had called him a “crying little shit” in a TikTok video he posted. Cohen responded, “Sounds like something I would say.” The prosecution quickly objected to the line of questioning, which Judge Merchan sustained. He then had counsel from both sides approach the bench for a quick sidebar.</p><p>Cohen confirmed that he has been following the trial and admitted that the proceedings are “personally” important to him. Blanche asked him if the prosecutors in the case have requested that he stop discussing the case publicly. Cohen said they had, and acknowledged that he’s continued to talk to the press about the case anyway. Blanche asked Cohen about his media appearances and how frequently he discusses Trump publicly. Cohen said he mentions Trump every time he records his podcast or a TikTok. At one point, Blanche asked point-blank if Cohen wanted to see Trump convicted in this case. “Sure,” he said bluntly.</p><p>Though now disbarred, Cohen often took a lawyerly approach to his answers. Blanche asked Cohen if his TikToks make money, and he responded, “Money is made from it, yes.” Per <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-14-24/h_4bbe38671ecd55595003ff7360eabd7c">CNN</a>, Blanche countered, “That’s not my question. One of the reasons you do it is to make money, yes or no?” Cohen eventually said “yes.”</p><p><strong>Regrets, he’s had a few</strong></p><p>Before the prosecution ended its questioning, Cohen was asked if he had any regrets about his past association with Trump. He said he did.</p><p>“I regret doing things for him that I should not have. Lying, bullying people in order to effectuate the goal,” Cohen <a href="https://twitter.com/KatiePhang/status/1790425624659816633">admitted</a>. “I don’t regret working for the Trump Organization. As I expressed before, some very interesting, great times. But  to keep the loyalty and to do things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass and I suffered the penalty and so has my family.”</p><p><strong>Asking for loyalty</strong></p><p>Cohen described meeting defense attorney Robert Costello in the Loews Regency conference room after the raid on Cohen’s apartment there in 2018. He said Costello would act as a back-channel to Trump, with Costello passing his communications with Cohen along to Rudy Giuliani, who had joined Trump’s legal team. The court was shown a series of emails between Costello and Cohen, including one where Costello wrote, “Sleep well tonight. You have friends in high places.” Cohen testified that he understood that he understood that to be a reference to Trump. Cohen described Costello’s emails to him as being “part of the pressure campaign that everyone is lying to you, that you are still regarded.” Cohen said Costello’s emails to him were “part of the pressure campaign” to make sure he didn’t turn on Trump. He claimed a conversation with his family is what prompted him to reconsider his allegiance to Trump and his decision to plead guilty. “I made a decision based again on the conversation I had with my family that I would not lie for President Trump anymore,” Cohen said.</p><p><strong>The last time Cohen and Trump spoke</strong></p><p>Cohen testified about the day the FBI raided conducted a raid on his office in April 2018. He described opening the door to his room at the Loews Regency hotel early in the morning to find a group of agents who later confiscated his phones and other devices. Cohen said he was “despondent” and “angry” following the raid and said he left a message for Trump, which he later returned.</p><p>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/14/nyregion/trump-trial-news-michael-cohen/64c07c7d-1d48-55ec-b6d7-40cff6a1449f?smid=url-share">said</a> to him, “Don’t worry. I’m the president of the United States. There’s nothing here. Everything’s going to be okay. Stay tough.

Cohen told Davidson, “Write a strong denial comment for her like you did before.” The court was shown a statement that Daniels issued, denying the affair. Cohen said he knew it was false because he helped to “craft it.” Cohen also discussed his response to the Federal Election Commission, which opened an investigation into the payment following the article’s release. He said the letter was intentionally “misleading,” saying that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was involved with the payment, rather than Trump himself. His reasoning? “In order to protect Mr. Trump, to stay on message, to demonstrate continued loyalty,” Cohen <a href="https://twitter.com/KatiePhang/status/1790392832043442470">said</a>.</p><p><strong>Speaker Johnson defends Trump</strong></p><p>Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up on Tuesday to support Trump, gave prepared remarks outside the courthouse, <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1790384604458762522">defending </a>the ex-president and denouncing his criminal trial as a “sham.” He took no questions from the assembled members of the media.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Speaker Johnson just made statements to reporters here in NY and then rushed away taking no questions.

<p><strong>Cohen back on the stand</strong></p><p>On Tuesday morning, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger picked up where she left off in her questioning of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney. Cohen spoke about meeting Trump in the White House in February 2017. He said that in the Oval Office, the two discussed how Cohen would be reimbursed for the money he fronted for the Stormy Daniels payment. Cohen testified that Trump told him he would receive a check for January and February and <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaBower/status/1790378248070685182">said </a>to “deal with Allen,” referring to Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. Cohen confirmed that he wasn’t under a retainer and that the invoices he filed for legal services were false and were intended for his reimbursement. He said that he received 11 checks totaling $420,000, and that Eric Trump and Weisselberg signed the first two checks, but that Trump himself signed them starting in April.</p><p>In anticipation of his likely contentious cross-examination, the prosecution asked about Cohen’s testimony before Congress, which resulted in him pleading guilty to lying under oath. Cohen said he felt “tremendous pressure” after he was called to testify and acknowledged that he lied to Congress about the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-elections-politics-north-america-28301de8eaa94cc796c5279fc28c1fdb">discussions surrounding Trump Tower Moscow</a>.

<p><strong>Cohen’s testimony from inside the room</strong></p><p>From his vantage point in the courtroom,<em> New York</em>’s Andrew Rice <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-cohen-finally-talks-back-to-the-boss-donald-trump.html">wrote </a>about how Trump attempted to exude an air of confidence as his former lawyer Michael Cohen took the stand:</p><blockquote><p>As the witness parsed his incriminating words for the jury, Trump made sure everyone in the courtroom could see his mind was elsewhere. He was ostentatiously reading from a sheaf of papers he had carried with him into the courtroom. He plucked up the next page and leaned back in his chair, allowing me to catch a glimpse of a familiar set of red and blue bar graphs. It was the latest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/us/politics/biden-trump-battleground-poll.html">New York<em> Times</em> poll of battleground states</a>. Before coming into court in the morning, Trump had waved the <em>Times</em> story accompanying the poll in front of reporters in the hallway, saying it “shows us leading everywhere by a lot.” Up by three in Pennsylvania, seven in Arizona and Michigan, ten in Georgia, 12 in Nevada. “I think we’re leading in New Jersey,” Trump said, citing as evidence the size of his rally over the weekend in Wildwood.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let the star witness testify, Trump seemed to be saying. He was winning where it mattered.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Day 16: The People Call Michael Cohen</strong></p><p>Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen took the stand Monday, the biggest day of testimony yet in the trial.</p><p><strong>The heart of the matter</strong></p><p>Cohen testified that he and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg worked out the process for reimbursing him for the Stormy Daniels’s payment plus the additional money he was owed, discussing the matter in Trump’s New York office. Weisselberg calculated the final sum to be $420,000, which Cohen would be paid over a span of 12 months. Cohen would be required to submit an invoice and would later be issued a check for “legal services rendered.”</p><p><strong>Cohen wanted to be considered for top White House jobs</strong></p><p>After Trump was elected, Cohen said his name came up in discussions about potential job in his administration. He testified that though he knew he wasn’t a good fit, Cohen was disappointed that he wasn’t considered for chief of staff. “It was more about my ego than anything,” he admitted. Cohen said he pitched being “personal attorney to the president,” an unpaid role that would’ve allowed him to pick up other jobs due to his connection to Trump. Cohen testified that his end-of-the-year bonus in 2016 from the Trump Organization had been cut significantly, which he found “insulting” after he fronted $130,000 on Trump’s behalf. “I didn’t expect more, but I certainly didn’t expect less,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/13/nyregion/trump-trial-michael-cohen/9088e97b-5d27-58a1-a56f-6ad72eb8ea86?smid=url-share">said</a>. Cohen said Trump promised he’d take care of the bonus.</p><p><strong>Why and how Cohen made the large Daniels payment</strong></p><p>Cohen said he discussed the Daniels payment with Weisselberg. The Trump Organization CFO asked if AMI would cover the money, but Cohen said that was unlikely. The Trump Organization CFO then suggested that Cohen make the payment since he personally could not due to family expenses. Cohen ultimately agreed to and he testified that Trump told him he would “get the money back.” The attorney used his home-equity line of credit to pay Daniels in order to hide the large sum of money from his wife.</p><p>Hoffinger asked Cohen if he would’ve made the payment without Trump’s approval. He said no. “Everything required Mr. Trump’s sign-off,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/eorden/status/1790091929050300551">said</a>. “On top of that, I wanted the money back.” Cohen said he informed Trump as soon as he received Daniels’s signed agreement.</p><p>“This matter is now completely under control and locked down,” Cohen told him.</p><p><strong>Cohen talks <em>Access Hollywood</em> and Stormy Daniels</strong></p><p>Cohen said that he was abroad in London when he received a call from Hope Hicks about the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape. He recalled thinking at the time that the tape would be “significantly impactful especially with women voters.” He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/13/nyregion/trump-trial-michael-cohen/461672a2-df86-55a9-af4e-2c87129e6502?smid=url-share">said</a> Trump described the words on the tape as “locker-room talk,” attributing the term to Melania Trump. Not long after the tape’s release, Cohen learned from Howard that adult-film star Stormy Daniels was trying to sell her story of a sexual encounter with Trump. When asked about his reaction to the story potentially coming out, Cohen said it would’ve been “catastrophic” for the campaign. When Cohen relayed the news to Trump, he said he was angry and that he thought Cohen had taken care of this. He recalled Trump saying it would be a “total disaster” for the campaign and saying that “women will hate me.”</p><p>The defense has argued that Trump was motivated to make a deal with Daniels to protect his family, but Cohen said differently on the stand. Cohen recalled asking Trump what Melania might think. “He goes, ‘How long do you think I’ll be on the market for? Not long.’ He wasn’t thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign,” Cohen <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-13-24/h_f4b12f00fc99f58c7e40bbbc5c70fe75">said</a>. The prosecution displayed an email from Keith Davidson, Daniels’s attorney with the original $130,000 deal between Daniels and Trump. Cohen took credit for the punitive damages clause that would fine Daniels $1 million per violation of the non-disclosure agreement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/13/nyregion/trump-trial-michael-cohen/fa115738-5e02-5fb7-b4b3-0d9238bef572?smid=url-share">adding </a>that it was “to ensure that she didn’t speak.”</p><p>Cohen confirmed that he lied on the bank paperwork to form Resolution Consultants, LLC, the company he initially planned to use to transfer the money to Daniels. “I’m not sure if they would’ve opened it if it stated to pay off an adult film star for a nondisclosure agreement,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-13-24/h_d05da8806fee941a2479ff938edc1f58">said</a>. He would go on to create a second LLC, Essential Consultants, for that purpose. Cohen was shown the wire transfer between himself and Davidson. Though the reason for the payment was listed as “retainer,” Cohen confirmed that this was false and that the money was in exchange for the rights for Daniels’s story.</p><p><strong>Cohen on his secret recording</strong></p><p>In September 2016, Cohen secretly <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-cohens-secret-tapes-will-roil-the-trump-trial.html">recorded a conversation</a> between himself and Trump discussing the McDougal deal. In the clip, which was played for the jury, Cohen says he’s talked to Weisselberg about opening up an LCC to transfer info to “our friend David,” an apparent reference to Pecker. Trump can be heard saying, “pay with cash,” though Cohen testified that he was against this idea. Cohen said he recorded the conversation for Pecker’s benefit, so he would know his repayment was being discussed. He confirmed that he sought to open an LLC in order to have “separation” from Trump. Per Cohen, the recording cuts off because he received an incoming call at the time.</p><p><strong>The Karen McDougal deal</strong></p><p>During his testimony, Cohen described talking to Trump about model Karen McDougal who alleged she had an affair with him. When Cohen asked Trump if he knew McDougal, he <a href="https://twitter.com/eorden/status/1790030963172368625">responded</a>, “She’s really beautiful.” Cohen told Trump that she was shopping her story, prompting him to order Cohen to “make sure it doesn’t get released.” The prosecution displayed a series of text messages between Cohen and Howard after he met with McDougal. In one exchange, Howard wrote, “Understand I’ve got this locked down for you. I won’t let it out of my grasp.” Cohen testified that he was in the room as Trump took a call on speaker with Pecker about the McDougal story. When Pecker said that it would cost $150,000 to “control the story,” Trump responded, “No problem, I’ll take care of it.” When Cohen informed Trump once the deal was complete, he seemed pleased. “Fantastic,” Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/13/nyregion/trump-trial-michael-cohen/d293206e-ec4b-5989-9326-862d7f7e7ab3?smid=url-share">said</a>.</p><p>Pecker began to apply pressure on Cohen about getting reimbursed for the money used to pay for McDougal and doorman stories.

<p><strong>Meeting David Pecker</strong></p><p>Cohen testified about the key 2015 meeting at Trump Tower between himself, Trump, and American Media, Inc CEO David Pecker where the three discussed placing positive stories about Trump in the <em>National Enquirer </em>while running negative ones about Trump’s rivals during the election season. Cohen said Pecker’s offer also went beyond what went into print. “What he said was that he could keep an eye out for anything negative about Mr Trump, and that he would be able to help us to know in advance what was coming out and try to stop it from coming out,” he said.</p><p>Cohen described Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/13/nyregion/trump-trial-michael-cohen/5ccd5597-0bc1-5d44-a009-ea421509eb2b?smid=url-share">warning</a> him ahead of his presidential campaign launch that stories might emerge once he jumped into the race. “You know that when this comes out, meaning the announcement, just be prepared, there’s going to be a lot of women coming forward,” Cohen recalled Trump saying.</p><p>The first test of this new partnership was a circulating story about a Trump Tower doorman who was shopping details about an alleged lovechild of Trump’s. Cohen testified that he advised Trump on it and that he told him to “handle it.” He described keeping tabs on Pecker and <em>National Enquirer</em> editor-in-chief Dylan Howard as they moved to acquire the doorman’s story, updating Trump as the deal progressed. Cohen said he went to Trump immediately when the $30,000 deal was struck, wanting to ensure he got credit for his work. “That’s great,” Trump reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaBower/status/1790029529114632637">said</a>.</p><p><strong>Cohen faces Trump</strong></p><p>After weeks of anticipation, the prosecution called Michael Cohen to the stand at the start of Monday’s proceedings. Trump did not appear to react when Cohen was asked to identify him by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger. Cohen described how Trump offered him a job after he went to him about a $100,000 bill for work that Cohen’s firm did for Trump. “And I was honored, I was taken by surprise,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-13-24/h_6834ab26851f1fe34ed9e0bd5b28de8c">said</a>. Cohen indicated that he worked directly for Trump and not out of Trump Organization’s general counsel office. The lawyer testified that he would renegotiate bills on Trump’s behalf, including vendors for the defunct Trump University, as well as challenge the press when negative stories about his client ran.</p><p>Cohen said he spoke to Trump multiple times a day in person or over the phone and was “required” to keep Trump constantly informed of what he was doing. Cohen confirmed that Trump didn’t use email due to his concerns about a paper trail. “He knows too many people who have gone down as a direct result of having emails that prosecutors can use in a case,” Cohen said. He testified that he would lie on Trump’s behalf and sometimes even bully or browbeat people in order to do what was asked of him. “The only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task, to make him happy,” Cohen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/13/nyregion/trump-trial-michael-cohen/956ae780-8614-5405-b53d-58603dae5b59?smid=url-share">said</a>.</p><p><strong>New additions to Trump’s entourage</strong></p><p>On Monday, Trump was accompanied to court by several of his Republican allies. New York congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis was spotted in the <a href="https://twitter.com/abbydphillip/status/1790007555965526248">hallway </a>outside the courtroom while Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio and Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama were also in tow.</p><p><strong>Day 15: A Half-Day Without Fireworks</strong></p><p>On Friday, Madeleine Westerhout, Trump’s former executive assistant at the White House, returned to the stand for further testimony. The proceedings ended early after the court heard from several custodial witnesses on cell-phone records and text messages submitted into evidence.</p><p><strong>Prosecution could rest its case next week</strong></p><p>Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said that his team intends to call two more witnesses next week and indicated that it’s reaching the end of its case. “And I think it’s entirely possible we will rest by the end of next week,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-10-24/h_e994f882e09b6f26bbc34914edb66202">said</a>.</p><p><strong>Tweets, calls, and texts</strong></p><p>Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal with the Manhattan DA’s office, was called back to the stand. She previously testified about her role reviewing social-media posts as part of the investigation. Longstreet read several past tweets from Trump that showed his changing feelings toward Cohen. In one, Trump accused the New York <em>Times</em> of trying to “destroy” Cohen in order to get Cohen to flip on him. In another, Trump criticized his former lawyer’s legal abilities:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!</p>&mdash; Donald J.

<p>In addition, Longstreet reviewed text messages exchanged in 2016 between <em>National Enquirer </em>editor-in-chief Dylan Howard and Gina Rodriguez, Daniels’s former publicist. In one exchange, Rodriguez referred to Daniels as Trump’s “mistress,” supporting her story that they had sex. The texts provided additional details on the negotiations between the tabloid and Daniels’s team over her story. At one point, Rodriguez suggested as much as a $250,000 payment for Daniels, though that was eventually negotiated down.</p><p>The court also heard from Jaden Jarmel-Schneider, another paralegal from the district attorney’s office, who analyzed phone records, including those from Cohen’s phone. He confirmed the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-10-24/h_a781d9c4c6516401f3bee5d38da32a7d">existence of calls</a> between Cohen and Howard, Rodriguez, former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, as well as AMI publisher David Pecker.</p><p><strong>A pair of telecom custodial witnesses</strong></p><p>The court heard brief testimony from two witnesses: Daniel Dixon, a compliance analyst with AT&T, and Jennie Tomalin, a senior analyst with Verizon. The two were subpoenaed as records custodians for their companies, verifying the authenticity of the records being submitted into evidence. AT&T records for Cohen’s cell phone were entered as well as Verizon phone records for Weisselberg and attorney Keith Davidson.</p><p><strong>A message from Stormy</strong></p><p>Following the end of her testimony on Thursday, adult-film star Stormy Daniels took to Twitter to goad Trump about potentially testifying. The attorneys on Trump’s defense team had requested a change to Trump’s gag order in order to allow him to respond to Daniels’s testimony, but their motion was denied by Merchan.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Real men respond to testimony by being sworn in and taking the stand in court.

<p><strong>Cross-examination of White House aide concludes</strong></p><p>The defense continued its cross-examination of Westerhout, Trump’s former White House executive assistant, on Friday morning. She testified that she recalled Trump speaking with Weisselberg, the former Trump Organization CFO, during the first year of Trump’s presidential term but no specific conversations about checks. Trump’s attorney Susan Necheles tried to <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaBower/status/1788932275926679747">suggest</a> that the system of sending Trump’s personal mail, like checks, to his employees’ personal addresses was simply to help Trump receive things quickly owing to the White House’s slow security process.</p><p>Westerhout confirmed that she spoke to Trump about the Daniels story in 2018 and that he was “very upset” by it. She said he knew it would be hurtful to his family, but she clarified that Trump never made this point to her directly. Her comment was ultimately struck from the record.</p><p><strong>Merchan rejects subpoena of Mark Pomerantz</strong></p><p>Before court began, Judge Merchan denied a subpoena from Trump’s legal team for Mark Pomerantz, a former special assistant district attorney.

<p><strong>Michael Cohen expected to testify next week</strong></p><p>The court will soon hear from Cohen, the prosecution’s top witness in the case. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGrumbach/status/1788909338955743266">reports</a>, Trump’s former lawyer could take the stand as soon as Monday.</p><p><strong>Day 14: Stormy’s Back</strong></p><p>On Thursday, Trump’s team completed its cross-examination of Stormy Daniels. Judge Merchan denied a second mistrial motion from the defense as well as a request to modify Trump’s gag order in order to allow him to respond to Daniels’s testimony.</p><p><strong>Merchan denies second mistrial motion.</strong></p><p>Before court adjourned for the day, Merchan took time to consider a series of motions from Trump’s defense team. The judge denied their motion to alter the gag order in order to allow Trump to respond to Daniels’s testimony. Todd Blanche, one of Trump’s attorneys, then put forward a second motion calling for a mistrial, once again claiming that Daniels’s story contained salacious details that weren’t relevant to the case. He pointed to Daniels saying she spanked Trump with a magazine. “How that’s relevant to why we’re here, especially when you weigh it with the prejudicial nature,” he said. Blanche also criticized the prosecution’s questioning.</p><p>Merchan ultimately rejected the defense’s request for a mistrial. At one point, the judge seemed to criticize the defense’s approach, suggesting that they could’ve objected to some of the prosecution’s questions in the moment.</p><p><strong>Trump’s former White House assistant speaks</strong></p><p>Madeleine Westerhout, Trump’s former executive assistant at the White House, took the stand Thursday afternoon after being mentioned in testimony given by several earlier witnesses. Westerhout, who worked in what’s known as the “Outer Oval,” described her former boss as being very detail oriented, preferring hard copies and in-person meetings to email. She said he would even make handwritten edits to post drafts or dictate potential tweets. (“It’s my understanding that he liked to use the Oxford comma,” Westerhout said, prompting a laugh from Trump in the courtroom.) She confirmed that Trump’s longtime assistant Rhona Graff sent her a list of frequent contacts during the presidential transition. The list featured the names of publisher David Pecker and Michael Cohen but also more prominent ones including Tom Brady, Sean Hannity and Serena Williams.</p><p>The prosecution showed an email from Westerhout to Cohen, on February 5, 2017, that confirmed a 4 p.m. meeting on Wednesday. On the email, Westerhout said, “Mr. Cohen was coming in to meet with the president.” On the subject of checks, Westerhout recalled bringing Trump stacks of checks and invoices for him to sign by hand. After he was finished, he would hand her the folder of checks that she then sent off to be mailed by FedEx.</p><p>Westerhout started to cry as she spoke about how her time at the White House came to an end. She was forced to leave in 2019 after revealing personal details about Trump’s family to reporters. As she cried, Merchan handed her a tissue. Westerhout wrote a book on her experience, tearing up once more as she explained that she wanted her book to show what Trump was really like. “I don’t think he’s treated fairly and I wanted to tell that story,” she said.</p><p><strong>And now for something completely different</strong></p><p>After two days of tense and, at times, explicit testimony from Daniels, the prosecution went a different route with its next witness. Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper for the Trump Organization, testified about how the company went about sending checks, a major part of the prosecution’s case. She said that Trump would pay his various expenses by check. Manochio testified she would send unsigned checks via FedEx to Washington, D.C., to Trump’s bodyguard Keith Schiller. The checks would return to her signed by Trump and then Manochio would hand them off to Deb Tarasoff in accounting, who previously testified. When the checks were returned, the FedEx invoices were still attached. The prosecution entered several of these invoices into evidence.</p><p>If she didn’t receive a check, Manochio said she would check in with Madeleine Westerhout, Trump’s executive assistant at the White House, who came up during Hope Hicks’s testimony. Manochio also said that she worked as an assistant to Allen Weisselberg, the company’s former CFO, and said he spoke to Trump daily. During a brief cross-examination, Manochio confirmed that she didn’t interact directly with Trump and that the checks she sent were for personal expenses, not ones for business.</p><p>Next up was Tracey Menzies, an executive at HarperCollins, which published books from Trump. Menzies’s testimony was used to introduce excerpts of <em>Think Big: Make it Happen in Business and Life. </em>Some of the quotes include “As a matter of fact, I value loyalty above everything else—more than brains, more than drive, and more than energy” as well as “My motto is: Always get even. When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.”</p><p><strong>More questions for Stormy from the prosecution</strong></p><p>Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger requestioned Daniels after the defense completed its cross-examination. She brought up Twitter exchanges that Necheles previously mentioned but pointed out that Daniels was responding to online harassment. In one post where Daniels said she would “dance down the street” if Trump were jailed, she was <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1788603058110226507">responding </a>to an unknown user who called her a “disgusting degenerate prostitute” and wrote “Good luck walking down the streets after this,” which she viewed as a threat. Daniels said that these posts were some of the “tame” ones that she’s received. She also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-09-24/h_119933233b7b58c99c7907f06b504ef2">testified </a>that she thought Trump’s TruthSocial post that read “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU” was about her because it coincided with a lawsuit he filed against her in Florida.</p><p>Daniels said that though she’s made money from this situation, it’s also cost her financially due to her need for additional security for herself and her daughter, several moves, as well as her legal fees. Hoffinger asked Daniels directly if she was telling the truth about Trump or lies. She <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-09-24/h_f3c951791f8516c69b6720354841477f">responded</a>, “The truth.”</p><p><strong>The defense challenges Stormy’s encounter</strong></p><p>Susan Necheles, a lawyer for Trump, tried to cast doubt on Daniels’s claim that she had sex with Trump at all, pointing at her work in the porn industry. “You have a lot of experience in making phony stories about sex appear to be real,” she said. Daniels seemed briefly taken aback. “Wow. That’s not how I would put it,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1788578935954907553">said</a>. “The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room.” Daniels <a href="https://twitter.com/srl/status/1788578743889396216">continued</a>, “If that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better.”</p><p>The attorney questioned why Daniels was shocked to see Trump undressed considering her career as a adult-film star. “If I came out of the bathroom and saw an older man in his underwear that I wasn’t expecting to see there, yeah,” she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-09-24/h_94fac3e8e15e96b811ad21444fae17d6">said</a>.</p><p>Necheles made reference to pass interviews with <em>Vogue</em> and <em>InTouch</em> to try to cast doubt on Daniels’s recollection of her tryst with Trump. “Your story has completely changed, hasn’t it?” she asked. Daniels <a href="https://twitter.com/Jose_Pagliery/status/1788589278085185582">responded</a>, “No, not at all. You’re trying to make me say that’s it’s changed, but it hasn’t changed.”</p><p>Before the cross-examination ended, Daniels confirmed that she hasn’t spoken with Trump since 2007. Necheles asked Daniels if she knew what Trump was charged with and knew anything about his business records? “I know nothing about his business records, no, why would I?” Daniels <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-09-24/h_8849190acdcf860093bf0e2cf4dbc458">responded</a>.</p><p><strong>Eyes on Trump’s eyes</strong></p><p>Trump’s focus has drifted throughout his defense’s cross-examination of Daniels. At times, he could be seen looking directly at her as she spoke.  But the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/09/nyregion/trump-trial-stormy-daniels/ee587214-ea45-5c74-9ed8-7493b0d9fa00?smid=url-share"><em>Times</em></a> reports that he occasionally appeared to be sleeping.</p><p><strong>Stormy’s cross-examination continues</strong></p><p>Trump’s attorney Susan Necheles picked up her cross-examination of Daniels from where she left off on Tuesday, arguing that she sought money for her story about Donald Trump. Necheles raised discussions Daniels had with a Slate reporter, suggesting that the talks fell through because the publication wouldn’t pay her for her story. Daniels said many people wanted to publish her story, but that she ultimately went forward with the non-disclosure agreement in order to have documentation backing up her story. “I wanted the truth to be printed with some paper trail,” she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-09-24/h_111de91151c9e5bead9544fd8156bed4">said</a>.</p><p>The back-and-forth between Daniels and Necheles quickly grew tense. Necheles asked Daniels if she ever said she would be instrumental in putting Trump in jail. She responded, “Show me where I said I’d be instrumental in putting President Trump in jail.” Necheles showed a tweet that came up during the previous day, with Daniels appearing to call Trump a “orange turd.” Daniels said, “I don’t see instrumental or jail anywhere in that; you’re putting words in my mouth.” Daniels did confirm that her tweet was a reference to Trump.</p><p>Necheles continued to try to draw links to Daniels’s story to ventures she later pursued such as a documentary, tour dates, and merchandise. In reference to another tweet, she asked Daniels if this was her “shilling” products from her online store. “I am doing my job. Not unlike Mr. Trump,” Daniels said.</p><p><strong>High anticipation</strong></p><p>The lines outside the courthouse were the longest they’ve been during this trial, as both members of the press and the public queued up early for a chance to see the rest of Stormy Daniels’s testimony. Though the building has, at times, been rather quiet amid dry testimony, the fireworks of Daniels’s first day on the stand changed the mood at 100 Centre Street.</p><p>A few new boldfaced names showed up: Judge Jeanine Pirro, a Trump ally, is taking in the trial from the overflow room.

<p><strong>No pictures</strong></p><p>Judge Merchan is no longer allowing photos to be taken inside the courtroom. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/hugolowell/status/1788555911826473292">reports</a>, a member of the press photo pool took a photo of Trump from the aisle rather than the well of the courtroom per court orders.</p><p><strong>What happened as Stormy spoke on Tuesday</strong></p><p>In a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-criminal-trial.html">dispatch from the courtroom</a>, <em>New York’</em>s Andrew Rice and Olivia Nuzzi detail the vibe as Daniels testified on Tuesday about her penthouse-suite encounter with Donald Trump:</p><blockquote><p>Despite Hoffinger’s assurance that morning that Daniels would stick to basic details, the witness was delivering a mortifying monologue and, for some reason, the defense was not offering objections. The atmosphere grew painfully tense. In the rows of benches behind the defense table, where the former president’s operatives and supporters sit, Eric Trump — the sole member of the family who has attended any portion of the proceedings — was staring rigidly down at his lap, possibly looking at a phone (though phone use is not permitted in the courtroom — a rule Donald Trump himself has violated)<strong> </strong>or maybe just averting his eyes.</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p><strong>Day 13: Stormy Daniels Testifies</strong></p><p>Court resumed Tuesday morning with Stormy Daniels, the adult-film star at the center of the case, taking the stand.</p><p><strong>A contentious cross-examination</strong></p><p>Susan Necheles, a veteran defense attorney on Trump’s team, immediately pushed Daniels on her negative feelings toward Trump. Necheles asked Daniels if she hated him. She said yes. She then asked if Daniels wanted him to go to prison. “I want him to be held accountable,” she said.</p><p>Necheles then raised that Daniels owes Trump $560,000 in legal fees stemming from an unsuccessful defamation suit she filed. The attorney tried to suggest that she was intentionally avoiding payment. “Isn’t it true that you are hoping that if Donald Trump is convicted, you’ll never have to pay him?” Necheles asked. She responded, “I hope I don’t have to pay him no matter what happens.” Necheles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/07/nyregion/trump-trial-hush-money-stormy-daniels/7818e76f-8519-5760-8caa-f26034e08a9b?smid=url-share">asked</a> Daniels if her telling her story has made her a lot of money. “It has also cost me a lot of money,” Daniels retorted. During <a href="https://apnews.com/trump-trial-updates-day-13#0000018f-54b4-d00b-a99f-fdf5951d0000">one exchange</a>, Necheles accused her of attempting to extort Trump.</p><p>“You were looking to extort money from President Trump,” she said.</p><p>“False,” Daniels responded, her voice raising.</p><p>Necheles kept going. “That’s what you did, right?”</p><p>Daniels once again said, “False!”</p><p><strong>A motion for a mistrial</strong></p><p>Trump’s team filed a motion seeking a mistrial, describing Daniels’s testimony up to that point as “prejudicial.” Judge Merchan agreed that some of what Daniels said was “better left unsaid,” but declined to rule in their favor. “Having said that, I don’t believe we’re at a point where a mistrial is warranted,” he said.</p><p><strong>The deal</strong></p><p>Daniels said her publicist first suggested selling her story in 2015, but said she learned Trump and Cohen were interested in purchasing the story in October 2016 following the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape. Daniels <a href="https://twitter.com/KlasfeldReports/status/1787884110028874016">testified</a> that she was not motivated to do the deal for $130,000, but out of fear. (She said she was threatened in a parking lot in 2011 by a man who told her to stop telling her story about Trump.) After her publicist and attorney took their cuts, Daniels said she received $96,000. She confirmed that she signed her name to a 2018 statement denying the affair following a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report on the hush money, but said she didn’t want to because it wasn’t true.</p><p><strong>A whirlwind account of sex with Trump</strong></p><p>After weeks of anticipation, Daniels took the stand just after 10:30 a.m. and began by talking about her rough childhood growing up in Louisiana before barreling into her career in the adult industry. She spoke so quickly that she had to be asked multiple times to slow down for the court reporter. Then came the key moment: the 2006 golf tournament in Lake Tahoe where she met Trump for the first time (she was 27 and he was 60 — “as old or older than my father”). Trump’s bodyguard invited her to join him for dinner, but she declined at first — until her publicist encouraged her to go, saying, “What could possibly go wrong?”</p><p>Daniels described meeting Trump in his penthouse hotel suite in detail, saying she teased him for appearing in satin pajamas, which he later changed. Trump asked about her family and showed a lot of interest in the business side of her work, which she noted was unusual for most people. Daniels said they briefly spoke about his wife, Melania, during their dinner, whom she called “very beautiful.” She said Trump told her not to worry, saying, “We don’t even sleep in the same room.” Reporters observed Trump shaking his head throughout her testimony.</p><p>After a brief break, Daniels delved into their sexual encounter. She described being “startled” as Trump exited the bathroom in the suite only to find him on a bed in a T-shirt and boxers. Daniels said she was intending to leave. “I felt the blood leave my hands and my feet almost like if you stand up too fast,” she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-07-24/h_d453c7406ba688914e4a326a053830e8">said</a>. “I thought, <em>Oh my God, what did I misread to get here?</em>” Daniels was clear that, though she didn’t object in the moment and wasn’t forced to have sex, she did feel there was a disparity in the power dynamic between them. “There was an imbalance of power for sure. He was bigger and blocking the way. I was not threatened verbally or physically,” she said.</p><p>Judge Merchan appeared frustrated at Daniels’s level of detail, after he instructed the prosecution earlier that morning to be mindful of being too explicit. “I had my clothes and my shoes off. I removed my bra. We were in missionary position,” she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-07-24/h_20fbd2dc788d6f2a639c96a49af2da68">said</a>, prompting an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/07/nyregion/trump-trial-hush-money-stormy-daniels/1f88af98-356d-55de-8d0f-abf03310c984?smid=url-share">immediate objection</a> from the defense. Merchan sustained. She testified that the encounter was brief and that Trump did not wear a condom. Afterward, Daniels said she quickly left the room. “I just left as fast as I could. That was it,” she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-07-24/h_3282b65761f0307128f85c20e658c67e">said</a>.</p><p>Daniels said that she saw Trump again the following day and several other times following their hotel tryst. She recounted meeting him in front of other witnesses including at Trump Tower and a launch party for his Trump vodka brand. When asked if she thought Trump wanted her to keep what happened between them secret, Daniels answered, “Absolutely not.”</p><p><strong>Trump’s books are used against him</strong></p><p>The first witness of the day was Sally Franklin, a senior vice-president and executive managing editor at Penguin Random House, which published several of Trump’s books. She was called as a witness to verify several excerpts from Trump’s books as they were entered into evidence. The prosecution had Franklin read Trump’s own words, attempting to show the defendant as a frugal man who paid close attention to where his money was going <strong>—</strong> part of their theme that Trump must have had to have known about the illegal payback scheme for which he is charged. During cross-examination, the defense tried to use Trump’s use of a ghostwriter to distance him from the text.</p><p>Franklin <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-07-24/h_f43bf617ed4f63dfa221128cdb304326">read</a> from <em>Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life</em>, quoting the author: “As I said before, I always sign my checks so I know where my money’s going. In the same spirit, I also always try to read my bills to make sure I’m not being over-charged.” The prosecution also entered the following quote from the same book: “My parents hammered frugality into me at an early age, and it’s the most important money-management skill a person can use.

The news seems to explain a hastily deleted Truth Social post from Trump, lamenting that his legal team had no time to prepare for the day’s expected witness.

<p><strong>Day 12: Trump’s 10th Contempt and the Hush-Money Receipts</strong></p><p>On Monday, Judge Merchan held Trump in contempt for the tenth time and warned him directly that he risks jail time for future violations.

The prosecution had raised additional violations during a hearing on Thursday. In an extraordinary moment, the judge addressed Trump directly and made it clear that “going forward,” the court might have to consider potential jail time if he continues to break the rules. “Mr. Trump, it’s important you understand the last thing I want to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-06-24/h_ded38faafea71a2f6963faee14e7637a">said</a>, but insisted, “I have a job to do.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Judge Merchan says Trump is a past president and &quot;quite possibly a future one&quot;  -  “this is why incarceration would truly be the last step for you.”<br><br>&quot;The magnitude of such a decision is not lost on me, but at the end of the day, I have a job to do.&quot;</p>&mdash; Morgan McKay (@morganfmckay) <a href="https://twitter.com/morganfmckay/status/1787475771327430892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Following the money</strong></p><p>The first witness of the day was Jeffrey McConney, the former controller of the Trump Organization, who was appearing due to a subpoena (with his attorneys paid for by his former employer). Trump “ran the organization. He was the brains behind it,” McConney <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-06-24/h_7da4895fe45d8a0cee49b34987eb5d02">said</a>. He confirmed that Trump had the authority to cut checks, but after he took office in January 2017, Trump’s two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, acted as signatories. Checks for amounts larger than $10,000 needed two signatures for approval.</p><p>The prosecution displayed a bank statement for Michael Cohen’s Essential Consultants, LLC, the company he used to make the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels’s lawyer Keith Davidson. The statement included a handwritten calculation made by Weisselberg, whose writing McConney positively identified. McConney <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-06-24/h_13017ea92fa4747945e6e3ed5b9f341c">walked the court</a> through Weisselberg’s notes that indicated that Cohen needed to be paid $420,000, a sum that covered the Daniels payment, a $60,000 bonus for Cohen, and taxes. Per McConney, Cohen was to be wired $35,000 per month and the attorney needed to submit invoices in order to be paid. In one February 2017 email exchange between Cohen and Weisselberg, Cohen <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1787494952320012460">wrote</a>, “Dear Allen, pursuant to a retainer agreement kindly remit payment …” McConney testified that he never saw the agreement and reached out to Weisselberg via email to approve the invoice. The CFO <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaBower/status/1787497797911982440">responded</a>, “Ok to pay as per agreement with Don and Eric.” At first, Cohen’s checks came from the account for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, but McConney said they eventually were disbursed from Trump’s personal account. McConney went through the 11 invoices that prosecutors allege were falsified.</p><p><strong>On the records</strong></p><p>After a brief recess, the prosecution displayed two ledgers: one for the Trump trust account that showed three payments for “legal expenses” made to Cohen in January to March of 2017 for a total of $105,000 and another for Trump’s personal account that listed $315,000 worth of payments for the rest of the year. During his cross-examination, McConney said he never talked directly to Trump about the payments to Cohen and confirmed that Weisselberg never said what the reimbursement was for. In one exchange, Trump attorney Emil Bove pointed to an email from Cohen where he used a personal Gmail account rather than a Trump Organization address. He noted that Cohen’s email signature said “Personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”</p><p>“It doesn’t say ‘fixer’ does it?” Bove asked. McConney agreed.</p><p><strong>Another Trump Org employee speaks</strong></p><p>Deborah Tarasoff, a member of the Trump Organization’s accounting department, took the stand Monday afternoon after the court returned from a lunch break. Tarasoff, who has been with the Trump Organization for 24 years, confirmed that her employer is paying for her attorneys. Tarasoff testified that invoices of more than $10,000 had to be signed off by Trump, Don Jr., or Eric, supporting McConney’s earlier testimony. But she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-06-24/h_0505fcd47d661ca1d3cdb3d3f31e8ae0">said</a> that “only Mr. Trump” could sign checks from his personal account. Tarasoff <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1787554597365571687">said</a> that if Trump didn’t want to sign an invoice from Weisselberg, he would make it clear by writing VOID in his trademark black Sharpie. “If he didn’t want to sign it, he wouldn’t sign it,” she said.</p><p>The prosecution took Tarasoff through all of the checks made to Cohen in 2017. When asked if she approved a check for every month of that year, she responded, “If I got an invoice, I approved an invoice, yes.” In one instance in July 2017, the provided invoice didn’t include the intended amount. Tarasoff testified that Weisselberg and McConney directed her to pay $35,000 as normal. On the invoice, there was a written note that read, “Pay same amount per Jeff + Allen,” per <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-06-24/h_174fd16de7d1b5cfd4b0bca332f53d93">CNN</a>.</p><p><strong>An end in sight</strong></p><p>Before court adjourned for the day, the prosecution<a href="https://twitter.com/hugolowell/status/1787577630851478001"> estimated</a> that they have a little more than two weeks left of their arguments as of Tuesday.</p><p><strong>Day 11: Hope Hicks Takes the Stand</strong></p><p>Court began Friday morning with the continuation of the cross-examination of Douglas Daus, a forensic analyst from the Manhattan district attorney’s office. The jury later heard testimony from Hope Hicks, a former aide to Trump. Proceedings ended before 4 p.m. in order to accommodate an appointment for one of the jurors.</p><p><strong>Yes, you can testify, Trump</strong></p><p>As he left the courtroom Thursday, Trump had <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1786132874380333155">told</a> the press that he was unable to testify due to the gag order placed on him. But Judge Merchan <a href="https://twitter.com/eorden/status/1786389714385207798">made it clear at the beginning of Friday’s proceedings</a> that isn’t the case: “You have an absolute right to testify at trial if that’s what you decide to do after consultation with your attorneys.”</p><p><strong>Data analyst back on the stand</strong></p><p>Emil Bove, Trump’s attorney, continued his cross-examination of Daus. Bove continued his attempt to cast doubt on the 2016 audio recording entered into evidence by the prosecution yesterday. He asked about the chain of custody of Cohen’s phone that held the recording and whether a reset of the phone could “raise questions” about the audio. Daus testified that the audio of a conversation between Trump and Cohen appeared to cut off at the end and said that metadata could determine whether the file was edited or not.</p><p>Prosecutor Chris Conroy pushed back on Bove’s line of thinking during his chance to requestion Daus. Referencing Bove’s various questions about past wipes and usages of Cohen’s phone, Conroy asked simply, “Is it unusual for a phone to be used?” Daus replied, “No.” Conroy also asked Daus directly if he noticed any signs of tampering on the phone. He said he hadn’t.</p><p><strong>Trump tweets introduced as evidence</strong></p><p>After Daus finished on the stand, the prosecution called Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal with the Manhattan district attorney’s office. Longstreet testified that she has worked on the Trump matter for a year and the half and was tasked with saving news articles and social-media posts relevant to the case, including reviewing Trump’s accounts on both Twitter and TruthSocial.</p><p>The prosecution then displayed and played Trump’s video statement from 2016 responding to the infamous <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape. “Anyone who knows me knows that these words don’t reflect who I am,” Trump said in the video shared on Twitter.</p><p>Prosecutors introduced several additional social-media posts from Trump including an October 11, 2016, post with Trump railing against Senator John McCain for dropping his support of him and several tweets from the following days that criticized the emerging stories of women accusing him of sexual assault. In one from October 15, 2016, Trump wrote, “Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me!”</p><p>They also displayed more current posts from Trump on TruthSocial including one from March 15, 2023, in which he referred to Stormy Daniels as “Horseface” and another from August 4, 2023, in which he wrote, “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!”</p><p><strong>A moment of levity at Michael Cohen’s expense</strong></p><p>Longstreet got a big laugh in the courtroom while being cross-examined by Trump’s attorney Todd Blanche. He asked her about her familiarity with Michael Cohen and whether she had listened to his podcast, <em>Mea Culpa</em>. Longstreet replied, “Absolutely not,” prompting laughs throughout the room, including from both the prosecution and the defense.</p><p><strong>“The people call Hope Hicks”</strong></p><p>The prosecution called its next witness: Hope Hicks, a former top aide to Trump. The news was met with gasps and murmurs in the overflow room. Hicks took the stand wearing a dark suit. As Hicks began her testimony, her voice was quiet, and she was asked to lean in closer to the mic. “Sorry, I’m really nervous,” she said.</p><p>Hicks described how she began working for the Trump Organization in 2014 under Ivanka Trump and was later brought on to Trump’s presidential campaign to work on communications. She testified that she hasn’t spoke to Trump since 2022. When asked who she reported to during her time at the Trump Organization, Hicks said that all employees “in some sense” reported to Trump. “It’s a very big and successful company, but it’s really run like a small family business in certain ways,” she said.</p><p>During her time as press secretary on his 2016 campaign, Hicks said she spoke to Trump every day and that he would weigh in on media responses. Hope acknowledges knowing several people in Trump’s orbit including Michael Cohen and David Pecker, describing the latter as Trump’s friend.</p><p><strong>Hope Hicks talks <em>Access Hollywood</em></strong></p><p>Hicks testified that the first time she learned about the <em>Access Hollywood </em>tape was through an email from Washington <em>Post </em>reporter David Fahrenthold asking for comment about the tape. The court was shown the email, which included a transcript of Trump’s comments in the video. Hicks said she was “very concerned” about the email and forwarded the message to other members of the Trump campaign including Jason Miller, David Bossie, Kellyanne Conway, and Steve Bannon. She confirmed that she wrote to them in an initial message, “Need to hear the tape to be sure,” and “Deny, deny, deny.”</p><p>Hicks recalled Trump’s first reaction to the tape. “He said that it didn’t sound like something he would say,” she testified. Hicks went on to say that she and others on the campaign felt that the tape was a “damaging development” and “a crisis.” The court was shown the initial campaign statement on the tape, which described it as “locker room banter.” Hicks said she spoke with Cohen following the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape after he mentioned the possibility of another potentially scandalous tape’s existence. “There was no such tape, regardless, but he chased that down for me,” she said. The former Trump aide also confirmed that Trump considered his Twitter account to be crucial to his campaign and said that only Trump and one other staffer, Dan Scavino, were able to post on the account.</p><p><strong>Hicks first learned of McDougal from a <em>WSJ</em> reporter</strong></p><p>Hicks testified that she first learned of Karen McDougal following a request for comment from <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter Michael Rothfeld about a story that revealed American Media, Inc.’s, deal with the model. She said she forwarded the email to Jared Kushner because he was running a lot of the campaign at that point and was friendly with Rupert Murdoch, who owns the <em>Journal</em>. Hicks said she reached out to AMI CEO David Pecker about the inquiry. She said he described the deal as legitimate and said McDougal was paid for magazine covers and doing a fitness column.</p><p>Hicks said she also spoke to Cohen about McDougal, and the court was shown an email between them containing a potential campaign statement. Cohen sent along edits to the remarks, which denied the allegations in the piece.</p><p><strong>More from Hicks</strong></p><p>Following the lunch break, the prosecution displayed the <em>Journal</em> article in question, focusing on the comment given by Hicks denying the allegations. Hicks said those remarks represented the feelings of the campaign but couldn’t remember specifically if Trump directed her to put out the comment. The prosecution showed a series of text messages between Hicks and Cohen following the release of the <em>Journal</em>’s article, several days before the 2016 election. In one exchange, Hicks asked for Pecker’s cell-phone number, which Cohen provided. “Mr. Trump wanted to speak with him,” she said. Hicks later thanked Cohen and said Trump was able to talk to Pecker.</p><p>Hicks said she spoke with Trump about the story and he was worried about it. “He was concerned about the story. He was concerned about how it would be viewed by his wife, and he wanted me to make sure that the newspapers weren’t delivered to his residence that morning,” she said.</p><p>The prosecution asked Hicks about the events following the <em>Journal’s</em> 2018 story about Trump paying off Stormy Daniels. She said she spoke to Cohen about the piece and he denied that it was true. During a conversation with Trump, he told Hicks that Cohen did make a payment to Daniels as an act of kindness. When asked if that sounded like something Cohen would do, Hicks said it seemed out of character for him. “I didn’t know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,” she said. “He’s the kind of person who seeks credit.”</p><p><strong>The cross-examination becomes emotional</strong></p><p>Emil Bove, Trump’s attorney, rose to cross-examine Hicks after the prosecution wrapped up. As Bove began to ask her about her time with the Trump Organization, Hicks started to cry, pulling out a tissue from her purse. This prompted Merchan to call for a quick break. After they returned, Hicks apologized and Bove told her to let him know if she needs to take a minute.</p><p>The cross-examination began with Hicks’s recalling her time with the Trump Organization, confirming that she felt like she had Trump’s “trust and respect.” Bove had a line of questioning about Cohen, asking if he ever did things that weren’t authorized by the campaign or were unhelpful. Hicks agreed with this characterization. “He liked to call himself a fixer, or Mr. Fix-it, and it was only because he first broke it,” she said with a laugh.</p><p>Hicks testified that Trump was concerned about what his family might think about the mounting scandals. On Melania Trump, she said Trump really valued her opinion. “She doesn’t weigh in all the time, but when she does, it’s really meaningful to him and he really, really respects what she has to say,” she said. Later, Hicks said he didn’t want anyone in his family to be “hurt or embarrassed” by what was happening on the campaign trail. “He wanted them to be proud of him,” she said. Shortly after, Bove ended his questioning and Hicks was dismissed from the stand.</p><p><strong>Weird weekend message from Trump</strong></p><p>After court was adjourned for the weekend, Trump spoke to the press outside the courtroom as usual and wished everyone a good weekend in typical Trump fashion:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;They destroy people.

<p><strong>Day 10: Another Day, Another Hearing</strong></p><p>Court began Thursday morning with another hearing on more of Trump’s alleged gag-order violations. After the hearing, Keith Davidson, the former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, completed his testimony, and the prosecution called forensics analyst Douglas Daus.</p><p><strong>A second gag-order hearing</strong></p><p>Just two days after Merchan handed down his first penalty against Trump for gag-order violations, the judge held a second hearing on four additional claims made by the prosecution. Chris Conroy, one of the prosecutors, laid out the alleged violations, which include comments about Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen as well as former <em>Enquirer</em> publisher David Pecker. Conroy said they were once again seeking a $1,000 fine per infraction. “To minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/hugolowell/status/1786028887148777777">said</a>.</p><p>The judge did not seem impressed with the defense’s justifications for Trump’s loud open mouth:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blanche argues Trump *has* to respond to journalists.<br><br>Judge: &quot;It was *your* client who went down that holding area &amp; stood in front of the press &amp; started to speak.

<p>Merchan didn’t immediately issue a ruling; it’s not clear when that might come down.</p><p><strong>Stormy’s lawyer back on the stand</strong></p><p>Keith Davidson resumed his testimony on Thursday morning, and prosecutors asked him to detail how he received the $130,000 hush-money payment from Cohen. He described how the dynamic between himself and Cohen had deteriorated, requiring <em>National Enquirer</em> editor Dylan Howard to step in. Davidson said he believed Cohen wasn’t telling him the truth about why the payment for Stormy Daniels’s story was delayed.</p><p>Davidson was also asked about texting, “What have we done?” to Howard after it was becoming clear Trump had won the election in 2016. Davidson called it “sort of gallows humor,” because “there was an understanding that our efforts may have in some way — strike that — our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.” Davidson testified about the statement that Stormy Daniels initially signed, denying the affair between her and Trump. (Weeks earlier, Trump had shared the previously known document on Truth Social, alleging that it was newly discovered.) He said that he believed that he helped to prepare the statement. Davidson described Daniels’s claim that she didn’t have a “sexual and/or romantic relationship” with Trump as being technically true. “I don’t think that anyone had alleged that any interaction between she and Mr. Trump was romantic,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-02-24/h_5d9abf4c9c2a33a832085ee83731b0e9">said</a>.</p><p>When asked if he would describe the agreement between his client and Cohen as “hush money,” Davidson said no. “I would never use that word,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-02-24/h_9890bb53cdf0dfed5b523067998f924e">said,</a> adding that he would call it “consideration.”</p><p><strong>Cross-examination grows testy</strong></p><p>Emil Bove, a member of Trump’s legal team, began to cross-examine Davidson after a short break in the proceedings. Davidson testified that Cohen had anticipated receiving a job in Trump’s administration after the election, either chief of staff or even as high up as U.S. attorney general. But when neither of those roles panned out, Davidson spoke on the phone with Cohen, who he said was extremely upset. “I thought he was going to kill himself,” he said.</p><p>The back-and-forth between the two attorneys grew tense as Bove asked about extortion and whether Howard had concerns about running afoul of extortion laws. He raised several celebrities including Charlie Sheen, essentially accusing Davidson of extorting these celebrities on his clients’ behalf. Bove asked Davidson if he got Sheen to pay. He responded, “That settlement would be confidential and I wouldn’t it discuss it here.”</p><p>After Davidson gave a few denials or claimed he didn’t recall details, Bove suggested that his memory seemed “fuzzy.”</p><p>“We’re both lawyers. I’m not here to play lawyer games with you,” Bove said.</p><p>Davidson responded, “You’re getting truthful answers, sir.”</p><p><strong>An audio interlude</strong></p><p>At one point, Davidson was asked to don a pair a headphones to listen to audio recorded by Cohen during one of their phone calls. The call, which was not officially entered into evidence, wasn’t played aloud for the rest of the courtroom. Bove <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-02-24/h_0805148559049c1c34a51c697d248b91">asked</a> if Daniels sought to use “leverage” against Trump, with Davidson having used the word in that recorded conversation. He denied the claim.</p><p>During the prosecution’s redirect of Davidson, another clip of Cohen was played to the entire room. Per <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-02-24/h_3ce3ce4bdb1e25691fddd723e76c9196">CNN</a>, Cohen could be heard saying, “I’m sitting there saying to myself, ‘What about me. What about me.’ I can’t even tell you how many times he said to me, ‘I hate the fact that we did it,’ and my comment to him was, ‘But every person that we’ve spoken to tells you it was the right move.’”</p><p>In regards to the clip, Davidson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/02/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial/a5ea4254-ab16-512d-b5cb-08377ec583f9?smid=url-share">said</a> “the fact that we did it” referred to the payment made to Daniels.</p><p><strong>Another witness</strong></p><p>Following Davidson’s testimony, the prosecution called Douglas Daus, a forensics analyst with the Manhattan district attorney’s office. Daus testified that he was assigned to analyze and extract data from several cell phones belonging to Michael Cohen. According to Daus, one phone in particular had 39,745 contacts, which he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-02-24/h_4c12ffee220ccad800cfe2f67c83db5a">said</a> was “unusual.”</p><p>The prosecution used Daus’s testimony as an entry point to submit text messages between Cohen and Hope Hicks, a former top aide to Trump. Hicks is expected to testify in this trial at a later date. Daus later confirmed the veracity of the metadata associated with audio recordings on Cohen’s phones. The prosecution then played a recording featuring Trump’s voice for the court. In the clip, Cohen can be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-02-24/h_83f1892147840305269bb12d6ce72a49">heard </a>saying to Trump, “I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David.”</p><p>During a cross-examination, Daus <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerMcBrien/status/1786126246973161957">explained</a> the chain of custody for devices like Cohen’s.</p><p><strong>Day 9: Judge Rules Trump Violated Gag Order</strong></p><p>Court resumed on Tuesday after a day off. Before the proceedings began, Judge Merchan ruled that Trump had violated his gag order nine times by posting about his former attorney Michael Cohen and adult-film star Stormy Daniels, two likely witnesses in the case. He was ordered to take down offending social-media posts and pay a $9,000 fine. Merchan also wrote that he was open to jailing Trump for possible future infractions. The prosecution then continued its questioning of banker Gary Farro, who previously worked at the now-shuttered First Republic Bank, where Cohen, his client, set up the account used to pay Daniels. The court also heard testimony from Davidson.</p><p><strong>More on the McDougal and Daniels deals</strong></p><p>Davidson continued his testimony after the court returned from lunch. As the prosecution presented more text messages between him and Dylan Howard, the former editor-in-chief of the <em>National Enquirer, </em>Davidson relayed how the $150,000 McDougal deal ultimately came together. He said that American Media, Inc.’s counsel asked him to talk to Cohen, something he had been trying to avoid after a 2011 conversation. “I didn’t particularly like dealing with him, and that’s why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-30-24/h_ae4f7912e545515e61ef3571e3004705">said</a>.</p><p>The prosecution then began to ask Davidson about Daniels, whom he acknowledged was a former client of his. Davidson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/30/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial/8b017c9a-168a-5bfe-a931-2e9d61aadd55?smid=url-share">testified</a> that, after the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape, interest in Daniels’s story “reached a crescendo.” The Daniels deal was ultimately set at $130,000, as shown in an email between Davidson and Cohen, which had the agreement attached. Davidson drew it up using fake names for both parties with Daniels being listed as “Peggy Peterson” and Trump as “David Dennison.” (Davidson revealed that there is a real David Dennison, who played on his high-school hockey team. When asked how Dennison feels about his name being used, Davidson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/30/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial/cb4323cd-df2e-5f70-b0a0-ab369bd005b8?smid=url-share">said</a>, “He’s very upset,” prompting laughs in the courtroom.)</p><p>Davidson testified that Cohen didn’t provide the agreed-upon money as scheduled and that he felt that subsequent emails from him amounted to him providing excuses. Davidson said he also got the sense that Cohen wasn’t able to make the decision to pay himself, as he kept citing Trump’s campaign travel as reasons for the delay. “I thought he was trying to kick the can down the road until after the election,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-30-24/h_35b268ca59c6de9551a5f06b8e33de2c">said</a>. Davidson and Howard also discussed Trump’s frugality in a <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaBower/status/1785403430938308863">series of texts</a>.</p><p><strong>Deadline stuck to</strong></p><p>As part of his ruling on Trump’s gag-order violations, Merchan ordered the nine posts deleted by 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon. By the time court returned from lunch, all of the offending posts had been taken down from Truth Social and Trump’s campaign website.</p><p><strong>Stormy Daniels’s former lawyer testifies</strong></p><p>Davidson took the stand. He confirmed that he was there under a subpoena and that he was offered immunity but did not take it. He said that the retainer agreement between himself and McDougal gave him the authority to negotiate with the press on her behalf. The prosecution presented a series of text messages between Davidson and Howard. In one <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-30-24/h_b1fa31f6f12f15d4de852989b296aca8">exchange</a>, Davidson wrote, “I have a blockbuster trump story.” Howard responded, “Talk 1st thing. I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why …”</p><p>In another, Davidson said McDougal’s story was one that “should be told.” Howard said “I agree” in response.</p><p>Davidson described the behind-the-scenes negotiations over McDougal’s story, testifying about talking with ABC News as well as the <em>Enquirer</em> to “create a sense of urgency.” The ABC deal reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/akarl_smith/status/1785380676105113600">involved</a> a potential appearance on <em>Dancing With the Stars</em>. He <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-30-24/h_82f1b63577af898dab435bb9634791e5">said </a>McDougal wanted to revive her career but didn’t want to tell her story involving Trump, which made the deal with American Media, Inc. and the <em>Enquirer</em> more appealing. In other texts, Davidson first asked for a million dollars, but Howard indicated that the final amount would likely be in the “hundreds.”</p><p>“We’re going to lay it on thick for her,” Howard <a href="https://twitter.com/KlasfeldReports/status/1785352467888136319">said</a> in one exchange.</p><p>Davidson joked in response, “Good. Throw in an ambassadorship for me. I’m thinking Isle of Mann [s<em>ic</em>].”</p><p><strong>Trump dozes</strong></p><p>Once again, Trump was caught nodding off during his trial.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NBC News: Trump appears to have fallen asleep while listening to testimony — at times appearing to stir and then falling back to sleep.<br><br>Trump&#39;s eyes were closed for extended periods and his head has at times jerked in a way consistent with sleeping. <a href="https://twitter.com/MSNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MSNBC</a></p>&mdash; Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) <a href="https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1785348440513204585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Prosecution enters new evidence</strong></p><p>Robert Browning, the executive director of C-SPAN’s archives, took the stand. He said his network was subpoenaed by the Manhattan attorney general’s office in order to hand over videos of Trump. The prosecution proceeded to play three video clips of Trump that were entered into evidence. In one clip from October 2016, Trump slammed the women who accused him of sexual assault following the release of the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape. “As you have seen, right now I’m being viciously attacked with lies and smears. It’s a phony deal. I have no idea who these women are,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-30-24/h_c6a4b17f17a2263c93136cd5e7ac752d">said</a>.</p><p>In another, from a 2017 press conference, Trump could be heard praising his then-lawyer Michael Cohen. “Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer, he’s a good lawyer,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/30/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial/7cbc1bb6-9b3e-572f-9fdd-769c8d461304?smid=url-share">said</a>.</p><p>Next up was Philip Thompson, an employee of Esquire Deposition Solutions, a court-reporting company that produced the transcripts and video of Trump’s 2022 deposition in one of the cases involving E. Jean Carroll. Thompson was asked to verify the veracity of several clips of Trump, including one where he confirmed that it was his voice on the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape.</p><p><strong>Texas attorney general shows up</strong></p><p>Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who has experienced some legal troubles of his own, attended Trump’s trial today in a show of support.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With President Trump in NYC to sit through this sham of a trial.

<p><strong>Cohen’s former banker continues testimony</strong></p><p>Gary Farro, a former senior managing director at First Republic Bank, took the stand again on Tuesday morning, continuing his testimony from Friday. Farro testified that Michael Cohen’s account for Essential Consulting, LLC, which he used to pay porn star Stormy Daniels, was set up within five to six hours, which was swift. “Everything was urgent with Michael Cohen,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/30/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial/92aa80be-1884-52b3-97eb-e15859d3b644?smid=url-share">said</a>. According to Farro, Cohen said the account was for consulting and gave no indication that it would be used to pay Daniels. He said a connection to the adult-film world would’ve prompted further examination from bank officials. “It is an industry that we do not work with,” he said.</p><p>The prosecution displayed paperwork that showed Cohen transferred $131,000 from his home-equity line of credit into the account and tried to expedite the transfer. The next day, Cohen transferred $130,000 to the account of Keith Davidson, Daniels’s attorney. Farro <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-30-24/h_7c3a12904a9cb972b81d8c93d87d6b6b">said</a> the transfer was listed as a “retainer.”</p><p>Todd Blanche, Trump’s attorney, then began his cross-examination of Farro. Blanche acknowledged past testimony from Farro that he was assigned Cohen since he’s better with more difficult clients. “Cohen, you believe he’s an aggressive guy, fast speaker. Not easy if you’re not firm,” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-30-24/h_225cf583facc5aaba20411d8f21c9535">asked</a>. Farro agreed. The banker indicated that he was unaware that the account was opened as a shell company and said he would’ve refused Cohen’s request had he known. “If the client had told me that this would be a shell corporation, the account would not have been opened,” Farro <a href="https://twitter.com/KatiePhang/status/1785321974496920061">said</a>. Before he left the stand, Farro also confirmed that he never spoke to Trump directly.</p><p><strong>Merchan is open to jailing Trump over gag-order violations</strong></p><p>On Tuesday morning, Judge Merchan found Trump <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-does-donald-trump-gag-order-mean.html">in contempt</a> for violating the gag order he placed on him nine times. He ordered Trump to pay a $9,000 fine, $1,000 per violation.

<p>In the order, Merchan <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1785305646369259645">notes</a> that the court “will not tolerate continued willful violations” of the order and that jail time is a possible punishment for continued infractions.</p><p><strong>Trump can attend Barron’s graduation</strong></p><p>Merchan ruled that Trump can be excused from court on May 17 in order to attend the high-school graduation of his youngest son, Barron, citing the quickness of the trial so far. Trump had taken to social media, falsely alleging that the judge was refusing to let him go to the family event when his legal team first raised the issue earlier this month. Actually, Merchan had indicated that he would decide at a later date.</p><p><strong>Trump wants more from his legal team</strong></p><p>In a familiar pattern, Trump has apparently become frustrated with his own attorneys. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/us/politics/trump-trial-todd-blanche.html">New York <em>Times</em></a> reports that he has begun to complain privately about his legal team, particularly Todd Blanche:</p><blockquote><p>Although Mr. Blanche has been Mr. Trump’s favorite lawyer for some time, behind closed doors and in phone calls, the former president has complained repeatedly about him in recent weeks, according to four people familiar with the situation.</p><p><br /></p><p>He has griped that Mr. Blanche, a former federal prosecutor and veteran litigator, has not been following his instructions closely, and has been insufficiently aggressive.

  </figure><p><strong>A banker details his connection to Michael Cohen</strong></p><p>Gary Farro, a former senior managing director at the now-defunct First Republic Bank, took the stand as the trial’s third witness. Farro testified that Michael Cohen was previously a client of his and that the ex-attorney was assigned to him due to his ability to “to handle individuals that may be a little bit challenging.” He said he returned a call from Cohen in October 2016 about opening a new LLC account. Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold displayed an <a href="https://twitter.com/KlasfeldReports/status/1783950986089816098">email</a> from Farro that read, “Need an account opened for Mike Cohen immediately. He wants no address on the checks. Calling you now to discuss.”</p><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1783953066976329845">account </a>in question was for Resolution Consultations LLC, which Cohen intended to use to facilitate the payment to McDougal. Farro testified that he believed that Cohen planned to use the account for “real estate.” Documents presented by the prosecution showed that Cohen marked “no” on a form that asked if the LLC concerned political fundraising or a political action committee. Cohen <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaBower/status/1783955889990316374">answered similarly</a> on forms for a separate LLC that the former attorney would ultimately use for the Daniels payment: Essential Consultants LLC.</p><p><strong>Trump’s former assistant takes the stand</strong></p><p>Pecker wrapped up his testimony after four days on the witness stand. The prosecution then called its next witness: Rhona Graff, Trump’s longtime executive assistant. Graff, who is testifying persuant to a subpoena, said that her attorneys are being paid for by the Trump Organization, the company that employed her for 34 years. Graff testified that she recalled seeing Stormy Daniels in the waiting area for Trump’s office in Trump Tower prior to him becoming president. She also confirmed that Trump kept contacts for both Daniels and McDougal.</p><p>During her cross-examination, Graff was asked about her time working for Trump. “I never had the same day twice in all that time,” she said “It was a very stimulating, exciting, fascinating place to be.”</p><p>Graff also recalled Trump as being a “fair” boss. As she spoke, Trump could be seen smiling. Trump’s attorney Susan Necheles sought to explain Daniels’s visit to Trump Tower, asking Graff if she thought she was there in connection to a possible appearance on <em>Celebrity Apprentice. </em>Graff said she “vaguely” remembers Trump considering Daniels for the show.</p><p>After Graff left the stand following her relatively brief testimony, Trump was observed moving towards her and attempting to shake her hand as she left the courtroom.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Graf done.

<p><strong>The prosecution refocuses on the McDougal ‘catch and kill’</strong></p><p>In his redirect, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked Pecker more questions about the McDougal contract. Previously, Bove tried to suggest that McDougal did benefit from some of the aspects of the agreement and it wasn’t merely packaging for the suppression of her story. Pecker <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-26-24/h_a77a6cad319c360d03998926ff08748e">said</a> the added perks of magazine columns and covers were “included in the contract as a disguise.”</p><p>Steinglass questioned Pecker on his claim that he had no intentions of publishing McDougal’s story, suggesting that it actually went against the <em>National Enquirer</em>’s interests to do so.</p><p>“Had you published a story about a Playboy model having a year-old sexual affair while he was married with a presidential candidate, would that have sold magazines, you think?,” he asked.</p><p>“Yes,” said Pecker.</p><p>“That would be National Enquirer gold?,” Steinglass <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-26-24/h_a4a5a632493b00cb967f2d2b116f9ac6">said</a>.</p><p>Pecker once again agreed.</p><p>Steinglass brought up Pecker’s 2018 FBI testimony after court reconvened following a lunch break. Bove suggested in his cross-examination that Pecker contradicted himself on the stand when he said Trump thanked him for handling the McDougal and Trump Tower doorman stories, citing notes from that FBI interview. When asked if he told the FBI that Trump thanked him, Pecker said, “Yes I did.”</p><p>Before he wrapped up his redirect, Steinglass asked Pecker if prosecutors ever tried to influence his testimony. He answered no.</p><p><strong>Defense continues its cross-examination</strong></p><p>On Friday morning, Trump’s attorney Emil Bove picked up his cross-examination of Pecker from where he left off the previous day. Bove raised AMI running negative stories about Bill and Hillary Clinton, asking if they decided to do that prior to the August 2015 meeting between him, Michael Cohen, and Trump. Pecker confirmed that they did, saying it was beneficial for the company. Bove asked the former publisher if AMI ever recycled stories, raising pieces that they published about Trump’s political rivals like Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. “Yes,” Pecker said.</p><p>At one point, Bove referred to Trump as President Trump while questioning Pecker about a 2016 conversation, prompting an objection from prosecutor Joshua Steinglass. “He wasn’t president then!” he <a href="https://twitter.com/eorden/status/1783867087158415645">said</a>. Merchan sustained. During his opening statement, Bove’s co-counsel Todd Blanche had <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/-will-call-president-trump-defense-lawyers-vacillate-honorifics-rcna149180">said</a> his team would call their client President Trump “out of respect for the office that he held from 2017 to 2021.”</p><p>Bove also continued a line of questioning from Thursday where he tried to cast doubt on Pecker’s memory of events. He asked if Pecker made an error when he testified that Trump thanked him for his handling of the McDougal and doorman stories.</p><p>“Was that a mistake?,” Bove asked.</p><p>“No,” Pecker responded.</p><p>Bove then raised Pecker’s 2018 testimony to the FBI where he said that Trump expressed no gratitude. “I know what I testified to yesterday and I know what I remember,” Pecker <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-26-24/h_d567c6510375f40def79e6c6f95c00d6">said</a>.</p><p>Bove concluded his cross-examination of Pecker before the lunch break and Steinglass stood to begin his redirect.</p><p><strong>To testify or not to testify</strong></p><p>In the past, Trump has seemed confident that he will ultimately take the stand during his hush money trial. But during a post-court interview on Thursday, he appeared slightly less enthusiatic about the prospect:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Former President Trump now says he is “more or less likely” to testify in his hush money trial. <br><br>“If it’s necessary,” he said in an interview Thursday night.   <br><br>Walking back earlier comments that he would definitively take the stand.</p>&mdash; Kellie Meyer (@KellieMeyerNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/KellieMeyerNews/status/1783839274691141935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Turning up the heat</strong></p><p>Trump railed against a new enemy during his typical pre-court remarks: the air conditioning in the courthouse:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump: So we have another day of court in a freezing courthouse. It’s very cold in there.. on purpose I believe. They don’t seem to be able to get the temperature up. It shouldn’t be that complicated.

<p>For what it’s worth, yesterday’s temperature in the overflow room just down the hall was cool, but manageable.</p>

      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>How the Jury Will Be Selected</strong></p><p>Like any other trial, this one begins with the process of selecting a jury, which could take several days. Attorneys for the defense and prosecution will question a large pool of Manhattan residents until they find 12 jurors and six alternates. Judge Merchan drafted a <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFS/press/PDFs/Letter-re-jury-selection-4-8-24.pdf">42-question-long survey</a> for prospective jurors to fill out in order to determine their impartiality. In addition to personal questions, potential jurors are asked about their media diets, whether they’ve volunteered for Trump’s campaign or attended a rally, and if they’ve ever read any books or listened to any podcasts by Michael Cohen, a key witness for prosecutors, or Mark Pomerantz, the attorney who previously worked on the DA’s investigation into Trump. It also asks whether they have been a member of several extremist groups and movements, such as the Proud Boys and antifa.</p><p>Merchan <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/judge-restricts-access-jurors-identities-trump-hush-money-trial-rcna142348">previously ruled</a> that jurors will be anonymous and have their identities shielded from the public owing to the risk of “a likelihood of bribery, jury tampering, or of physical injury or harassment.” Trump, his attorneys, and prosecutors will have access to the jurors’ names and addresses.</p>

        </figure><p>We are continuously told that <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Donald Trump’s conviction</a> would be epochal, historic. This is perhaps true, but it means much less than we think.</p><p>The truth is that politicians get charged with crimes all the time. Many of them are convicted. U.S. Senator Robert Menendez is currently under indictment. Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich served time in prison and emerged, as many criminals seem to, with a renewed appreciation for Trump.</p><p>Even the conviction of a former president is novel only in the American context. Many global heads of state of democratic countries (France, Japan, Israel, etc.) have gone to prison.</p><p>In a global sense, Trump’s conviction in a court is not just fair but overdue. He has been flouting the law his entire adult life. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/us/politics/trump-charges-obstruction.html">reportedly</a> believed he enjoyed legal impunity due to his relationship with Manhattan’s prosecutor, though the basis for that belief has never been established. The extent of his criminality has oddly escaped notice, perhaps overshadowed by his constant offenses against truth and decency, or perhaps because people tend to think stealing is a crime when you aim a gun at a clerk but not when you <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/president-trump-crook-new-york-times-proves.html">create phony companies and bilk the Treasury</a>.</p><p>Once he ascended to the presidency, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-criminal-prosecution.html">Trump’s criminality</a> only grew. He issued illegal orders constantly, flummoxing his staff. He attempted (with unrecognized partial success) in turning the powers of the Justice Department into a weapon against his enemy, which was in turn an expression of his criminal’s view of the law: as an inherently hypocritical tool of the powerful against the weak.</p><p>The incongruity of the Manhattan case as the venue for Trump’s legal humiliation is that it did not represent his worst crimes, or close to it. The case was always marginal, the kind of charge you would never bring against a regular first-time offender. It was the sort of charge you’d concoct if the target is a bad guy and you want to nail him for something.</p><p>This, too, is not without precedent. Al Capone’s conviction for tax evasion is the paradigmatic example (one which fits his own case so closely Trump has felt compelled, seemingly as a kind of Freudian slip, to invoke the comparison). Hunter Biden was charged with lying about drug use on his firearm application, a crime so picayune it makes Trump’s conviction for high-money payments look like the St. Valentine’s Day massacre.<br />The legal ramifications of this weakness will play out in some indeterminate, possibly terrible fashion. Republicans will seek revenge, and are already <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/john-yoo-demands-revenge-prosecutions-against-democrats.html">demanding it</a>.</p><p>It’s possible that future criminal charges, all of which have a much stronger basis, will overshadow this conviction. The trouble is that all those trials are delayed, either by Trumpy judges, the indecisiveness of the Justice Department, or missteps by the prosecution.</p><p>Trump may win the election, come to power, and quash all the remaining cases. In that case, his Manhattan prosecution could well stand out as a weak-sauce gesture, one he and his allies cite as their rationale to harass Trump’s enemies with spurious charges.</p><p>If he loses the election, however, then he likely will face trial for attempting to steal the 2020 election, and then stealing classified documents, refusing to give them back repeatedly, and engineering a cover-up. In that case, the hush-money case will live as something not much larger than a footnote, the first pebble in a legal landslide.</p><p>Life isn’t fair, nor is the legal system. Throughout Trump’s life, the unfairness has run overwhelmingly in his favor. The balance of the unfairness remains on his side. He is now officially a criminal, but that is a designation that a fair system would have applied to him long ago.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p>It didn’t take a political super-junkie to see that <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/joe-biden-2024-election-strategy-trump.html">Joe Biden’s campaign</a> was shifting strategy when it showed up outside the Manhattan courthouse on Tuesday with Robert De Niro and a pair of police officers who protected the Capitol on January 6. Joined by the campaign’s communications director, the trio sprinted away from the president’s previous insistence that his political machine remain silent about Donald Trump’s trial. The cops painted Trump as unfit for office and De Niro plainly tried baiting him into a messy back-and-forth, largely around the idea that Trump had lost his mind after the 2020 election. Gone, apparently, was the Democrats’ concern about playing into the ex-president’s claims of political prosecution and their hope to appear above Trump’s sordid legal messes. At the very least, the brain trust in Delaware clearly calculated that, with their candidate stuck in a political rut five months from Election Day and with the jury about to deliberate — still two days away from finding Trump guilty on all counts — those risks were worth the reward: a rare slice of attention during the biggest show of the season, and thus another chance to try focusing voter minds on the fundamental choice facing them this fall.</p><p>For months now, Biden’s allies have responded to liberal gloom over him trailing in the polls against Trump by arguing that it will improve once semi-engaged Americans finally come to terms with the reality that they will effectively have a binary decision to make between Biden and Trump. Yet neither Trump’s easy GOP-primary victory nor the heavily covered trial itself forced that realization or caused a clear polling bump for Biden, nor has the tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advertising the Biden camp has recently poured into swing states. At least not yet. Biden troops are, of course, hopeful that the historic guilty verdict — and their new ability to call Trump a convicted felon — could help their cause. (For what it’s worth, Trump’s price <a href="https://x.com/gelliottmorris/status/1796287982057742712">immediately dove</a> on election betting markets.) But they have evidently determined that no matter what, they must turn the first month of this summer into a period of attention seeking that reminds Americans specifically of Trump’s lawlessness and chaos.</p><p>In the campaign’s first statement after the verdict, it offered a reminder. “Today’s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,” said communications director Michael Tyler. “The threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater. He is running an increasingly unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution, pledging to be a dictator ‘on day one’ and calling for our Constitution to be ‘terminated’ so he can regain and keep power.” It’s an effort they hope will culminate in the earlier-than-ever June debate that Biden arranged to reframe the way voters are thinking — or not thinking — about the race.</p><p>It is now obvious that no one moment in the campaign will shift the public’s sour mood on the overall environment and that it will take a more sustained effort. Even since the trial began, Biden himself has sought to lower his backers’ expectations of any kind of sudden wake-up call — at the beginning of May, he warned donors at a private fundraiser in Washington that people won’t “begin to focus until they get closer to September.”</p><p>Yet this isn’t just a case of the usual undecided voters engaging only after Labor Day, nor of Trump’s unusual hold on the news media. Rather, it is the product of a singularly difficult attention economy wherein many more Americans than usual appear to be simply tuning out election news altogether. This has presented Biden with a conundrum: Polls often show the president leading among the most keyed-in voters, indicating that, atypically for Democrats, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-needs-disengaged-unhappy-voters-to-stay-home.html">he may benefit from a lower-turnout election</a>. Yet he still likely needs plenty of his supporters’ less engaged neighbors and friends to turn out, and reaching them is harder than ever — recent months have proved that it is not as simple as running TV ads highlighting the considerable contrast between the candidates and showing up in battleground states for rallies. “It’s way more difficult than I’ve ever seen it to break through,” says Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who’s worked with Biden for years. “Normally a president really dominates.”</p><p>Lake has found that this dynamic is in part the product of a post-COVID shift in news consumption, where voters are avoiding traditional news coverage, assuming it will report negativity and instability. (In focus groups, even positive news about Biden’s record is often taken as a negative, or with a huge grain of salt, unless it is explicitly positioned to voters as a contrast to Trump.) In Lake’s telling, this brand of news avoidance is especially pronounced among women voters, who favor Democrats, and exacerbated in places where there is no longer any reliable local news outlet.</p><p>Thirty-four felony convictions for the man who has defined the last decade of American politics is, of course, a different kind of news event — far more likely to break through to casual or skeptical news consumers than most day-to-day political developments. So the coming month is almost certain to see an uptick in ads and communications from Biden supporters labeling Trump a felon, and his campaign also seems likely to try more surprise events guaranteed to draw headlines, like De Niro’s cameo.</p><p>Still, Democrats are hardly unified in the thought that this focus would fundamentally change the race by itself. Such an effort would likely be aimed at the roughly one-fifth of Republicans who report in polls that a felony ruling might make them reconsider or withdraw their support for Trump. Many liberal analysts are skeptical of these voters’ claims, given how many Republicans have gone along with Trump in the past (<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/nikki-haley-endorses-trump.html">see: Nikki Haley</a>), and point out that an effort to target these voters would still be focused on the former Haley supporters who continued to turn out in primaries this spring. That could be enough voters to swing a close election, but it is not the same group as the mass of disengaged Americans — often women, and Black and Latino voters, but especially young voters — who they believe should already be on Biden’s side.</p><p>One point of near-consensus in the Democratic ranks is that convincing this larger group of voters will largely entail making them feel better about their quality of life under Biden versus during the Trump years. Yet reminding them of Trump’s instability and unreliability can be a big part of this effort. And the push may come in a familiar form after all. Lake, for one, said that even though voters are seeking out less political news than ever, she has seen campaigns succeeding in getting their message across not just with traditional ads, but also when they pay to boost helpful news headlines and stories. This appeals in particular to voters in relative local-news deserts. And while Democrats have wrestled for years now with a broad public feeling that Trump always skates politically when it comes to his personal scandals, Lake said her research has shown that voters take certain transgressions more seriously than others. “The press presents this as a hush-money trial, but it’s an election-interference and business-fraud trial, and to get it to break through we’re going to have to be pretty focused on that,” she says. “Election interference and business fraud is a whole different ball game for voters.”</p><p>What’s not yet clear is how far Democrats will be comfortable leaning in on that particular argument, or how much money they plan to put behind it. Though the Biden camp signaled a new willingness to engage with the trial by showing up outside of it this week, its representatives still portrayed their appearance with a measure of defensiveness — they were there because the media was, they said. Any real comment on the legal proceedings themselves came only after the verdict was reached.</p><p>Yet the broader liberal frustration that they still have to convince people of Trump’s unfitness for the presidency was unmissable. At the microphones on Tuesday, with a verdict seeming far off, the Biden surrogates remained on message. “We can’t count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump. It’s going to take us Americans, at the ballot box, to defeat him once and for all,” said Harry Dunn, a former Capitol Police officer. But once the event was over, De Niro offered another take. “He is guilty, and we all know it,” he said in front of the mass of reporters and Trump sympathizers. “I’ve never seen a guy get out of so many things, and we all know this. Everybody in the world knows this!” Clearly frustrated, De Niro didn’t hesitate when asked if he believed Trump belongs in jail. “I sure do,” he said. “Absolutely.”</p><div><p>More on Trump on trial</p><ul><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates.html">Donald Trump Found Guilty on All Counts: Live Updates</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-conviction-biden-2024-election.html">Does Trump’s Conviction Mean This Is a New Campaign?</a></li><li><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-recap.html">What Happened in the Trump Trial Today: Guilty On All Counts</a></li></ul></div>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p>Republicans have long been predicting that criminal charges against Donald Trump would lead to Republicans ginning up charges against Democrats out of pure revenge. The prediction, of course, was designed to legitimate it. And now, inevitably, members of the Republican legal Establishment have moved from predicting this turn of events to advocating for it.</p><p>John Yoo, the former Bush administration lawyer (who himself escaped prosecution for his role in constructing legal justifications to torture detainees, many of whom turned out to be held <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/cia-torture-report-fast-facts/index.html">wrongfully</a> in the first place), has an <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2024/05/trumps-trial-has-already-damaged-the-office-of-the-presidency/">essay</a> in <em>National Review </em>arguing for revenge prosecutions. The imprimatur of Yoo, a Berkeley law professor and fellow at two of the conservative movement’s least-insane think tanks (the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution), underscores the progression of “lock her up” from wild seriously-not-literally Trump-campaign demagoguery in 2016 to party doctrine in 2024.</p><p>“Repairing this breach of constitutional norms will require Republicans to follow the age-old maxim: Do unto others as they have done unto you,” urges Yoo. “In order to prevent the case against Trump from assuming a permanent place in the American political system, Republicans will have to bring charges against Democratic officers, even presidents.”</p><p>I agree with Yoo that one of the cases against Trump, the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/donald-trump-new-york-indictment-bragg-should-not-be-brought.html">Alvin Bragg prosecution</a>, is weak. That’s not to say Trump is innocent, but that it’s a borderline case that did not need to be charged.</p><p>But Yoo is not confining his complaints to the Bragg case. He explicitly denounces <em>all</em> the charges against Trump, including the ones for attempting to negate the election results and for stealing classified documents, repeatedly ignoring or lying in the face of requests to return them, and engineering a cover-up.</p><p>There are several problems with Yoo’s argument, beginning with the “age-old maxim” he cites. The saying, derived from the Bible, is “Do unto others <em>as you would have done to you</em>,” not “Do unto others as <em>they have done unto you</em>.” I am not a biblical scholar, but the basic thrust of the teachings the line summarizes is to treat people the way you would wish to be treated, rather than instructing people to take revenge for slights.</p><p>Second, Yoo attributes Trump’s prosecutions to “the Democrats”:</p><blockquote><p>Make no mistake, Democrats have crossed a constitutional Rubicon. For the first time in American history, they have brought criminal charges against a former president. For the first time in American history, they have brought criminal charges against the major (and leading) opposition candidate for president during the campaign …</p></blockquote><p>Republicans keep asserting that the Democratic Party, or Joe Biden, collectively decided to throw the book at Donald Trump, but there is literally zero evidence for this. Biden has avoided interfering with decisions by the Justice Department, and the two biggest cases against Trump were brought by Jack Smith, who is a nonpartisan figure respected by both parties.</p><p>Third, Yoo’s examples of revenge prosecutions underscore his deep confusion about how the Justice Department has been operating. Here are some things he wants investigated: A Republican DA will have to charge Hunter Biden for fraud or corruption for taking money from foreign governments. Another Republican DA will have to investigate Joe Biden for influence-peddling at the behest of a son who received payoffs from abroad.</p><p>In fact, Donald Trump went to great lengths to do this very thing. William Barr, a Republican, <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/">did</a> investigate allegations of foreign payoffs by Joe Biden. He never brought charges because he was unable to find any legitimate evidence whatsoever to support the claim.</p><p>And David Weiss, who was appointed by Donald Trump, investigated Hunter Biden, and charged him with tax fraud and lying about his drug use on a form he submitted to purchase a gun. Note that these are the kinds of criminal charges a regular person would almost certainly never face. Hunter Biden is being charged <em>because</em> he is the president’s son, and has engaged in sleazy-but-legal dealings that made him a prosecutorial target.</p><p>If Yoo was remotely capable of perceiving reality objectively, he would grasp that these examples refute his assumption that “the Democrats” control various prosecutorial arms and have abused them for political purposes. Joe Biden assuredly is not on board with the Justice Department throwing his son in prison. But Yoo seems to believe Hunter Biden has somehow escaped prosecution.</p><p>The deepest conceptual flaw in Yoo’s demands for legal revenge is his belief that Trump is an innocent victim. “Democrats have crossed a constitutional Rubicon,” he argues. Before now, he claims, opportunities to prosecute presidents abounded but were never taken, out of principle:</p><blockquote><p>Gerald Ford, in a great act of statesmanship, pardoned Richard Nixon even though it doomed his chances in the close 1976 election. Bush did not prosecute Bill Clinton for lying to the Whitewater special counsel, even though Clinton’s Justice Department had conceded that he would become legally liable once he left office. Obama did not attempt to relitigate the difficult policy decisions made during the War on Terror by prosecuting Bush and his aides (of which I was one). Trump did not order the investigation of Hillary Clinton, even though her intentional, illegal diversion of thousands of classified emails to her home computer network was a central theme during his campaign. Nor had local or state prosecutors dared to interfere with the workings of the presidency before.</p></blockquote><p>It is true that presidents have gotten into legal trouble areas before. But no previous president actually attempted to stay in office despite losing an election. Another thing those other presidents had in common is that they were politicians who sometimes operated in legal gray areas, but fundamentally respected the legal system.</p><p>Trump is a career criminal who went into politics. Treating laws as suggestions is one of his basic maxims. Once in office, he continued to act like a crook. He routinely berated his lawyers for taking notes in his presence and urged them to act more like Roy Cohn, the mob lawyer he once employed and idolized. He regularly ordered people to violate the law, and sometimes promised to pardon them if they were caught, and is currently promising pardons for the insurrectionists in prison who committed violence on his behalf.</p><p>Yoo argues that what broke the system was the decisions to charge Trump with crimes, and what can repair it will be charging Democrats. I would suggest the solution instead would be for Republicans to nominate as their next presidential candidate an experienced, vetted politician rather than a professional swindler.</p><p>And yes, Bragg’s case is weak, but it too could have been avoided if the GOP didn’t pick a presidential candidate who had a standing catch-and-kill arrangement with the <em>National Enquirer</em>.</p><p>Ted Cruz or Ron DeSantis may be right wing, but they are not mobbed-up crooks, and they wouldn’t be facing prison right now if they had beaten Trump in their respective nominating contests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        </figure><p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-second-term-agenda.html">Donald Trump</a> has a lot of issues with tape. Some definitely exist, like the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/11/trump-now-not-sure-that-was-him-on-access-hollywood-tape.html"><em>Access Hollywood</em> tape</a> and the bits of Scotch tape he once used to <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/12/donald-trumps-tie-is-held-together-by-scotch-tape.html">hold his tie together</a>. Others are more mythical beasts, like the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/trump-melania-golden-showers-denial.html">pee tape</a> and the “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/06/trump-says-he-doesnt-have-any-comey-tapes-after-all.html">Lordy, I hope there are tapes</a>” tape. Today we got fresh details on a recording that falls into the latter category: the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/white-house-cant-guarantee-theres-no-trump-n-word-tape.html">Trump N-word tape</a>.</p><p>Bizarrely, we’ve reached the point where the fact that this story just won’t die is arguably more interesting than the alleged recording itself. From 2004 to 2015, Trump was recorded extensively while filming <em>The Apprentice</em>. During the 2016 election, journalists and the Hillary Clinton campaign <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/donald-trump-apprentice-outtakes">hunted for these tapes extensively</a>, as they were rumored to feature Trump making all manner of racist and sexist remarks. The idea that this trove included an “N-word tape” that would be the final nail in the Trump campaign’s coffin took off in the days after the release of the <em>Access Hollywood</em> recording on October 7. First, former <em>Apprentice</em> producer Bill Pruitt tweeted this:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a producer on seasons 1 &amp; 2 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/theapprentice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#theapprentice</a> I assure you: when it comes to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/trumptapes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#trumptapes</a> there are far worse. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/justthebegininng?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#justthebegininng</a></p>&mdash; Bill Pruitt (@billpruitt) <a href="https://twitter.com/billpruitt/status/784872190587998209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Chris Nee, another <em>Apprentice</em> producer, responded in a series of tweets that the “worse” content was Trump saying the N-word. Nee later deleted these tweets but they were <a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/160460/tom-arnold-says-he-has-apprentice-tapes-of-trump-saying-n-gger-and-retard#goog_rewarded">captured</a> by Mic:</p><blockquote><p>@mcuban the price is 5 million to cover the penalty fee. And we all get to hear him use the N-word from what I hear https://t.co/IsmJvHHL1KI don’t have the tapes. I’ve signed a Burnett contract and know leak fee is $5 million. Hearing from producers/crew N word is the “much worse.”</p></blockquote><p>Nearly eight years later, this tape has not materialized, but its legend persists. Comedian <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/05/tom-arnold-is-on-the-hunt-for-the-missing-trump-tapes.html">Tom Arnold</a> <a href="https://mynorthwest.com/492936/comedian-tom-arnold-claims-to-have-infamous-unreleased-donald-trump-outtakes/">claimed</a> to have seen the offensive <em>Apprentice</em> outtakes and had a short-lived and <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/tom-arnold-hunt-for-the-trump-tapes-review">poorly reviewed</a> show in which he hunted for them, to no avail. While promoting her book in 2018, former <em>Apprentice</em> contestant and White House official <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/trump-n-word-tape-omarosa-guide.html">Omarosa Manigault Newman</a> made conflicting claims about whether she’d heard the N-word tape herself.</p><p>Now Pruitt has clarified what he tweeted about there being were “far worse” things allegedly Trump said, namely the N-word. In a Slate <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/05/donald-trump-news-2024-trial-verdict-apprentice.html">essay</a> about what he saw while working on the show’s first two seasons, he says he was initially barred from speaking because he “signed an expansive nondisclosure agreement that promised a fine of $5 million and even jail time if I were to ever divulge what actually happened.” Now the NDA has expired.</p><p>Deep in the piece, Pruitt alleges Trump used the N-word while discussing who should win the first season of the show. He says Trump used the racial slur after his adviser Carolyn Kepcher praised contestant Kwame Jackson, who is Black:</p><blockquote><p>“Yeah,” [Trump] says to no one in particular, “but, I mean, would America buy a n— winning?”</p><p><br /></p><p>Kepcher’s pale skin goes bright red. I turn my gaze toward Trump. He continues to wince. He is serious, and he is adamant about not hiring Jackson.</p><p><br /></p><p>[Showrunner Jay] Bienstock does a half cough, half laugh, and swiftly changes the topic or throws to Ross for his assessment. What happens next I don’t entirely recall. I am still processing what I have just heard. We all are. Only Bienstock knows well enough to keep the train moving. None of us thinks to walk out the door and never return. I still wish I had. (Bienstock and Kepcher didn’t respond to requests for comment.)</p></blockquote><p>Pruitt says this exchange was “caught on tape,” though it took place off-camera, because <em>The Apprentice</em> was a game show subject to Federal Communications Commission regulation, and the showrunner wanted proof that they were not involved in a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/quizshow-aftermath-quiz-show-scandal/"><em>Quiz Show–</em>style scandal</a>.</p><p>So now we have at least one firsthand claim that Trump used the N-word on tape — and potentially three more witnesses:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Maybe more important than the tape, which I’m sure is lost to history, Pruitt names 3 other witnesses to Trump calling a black contestant the N-word. Would be pretty helpful if they could confirm or deny! <a href="https://t.co/lBgTR692ZO">https://t.co/lBgTR692ZO</a> <a href="https://t.co/G9XEqod6my">pic.twitter.com/G9XEqod6my</a></p>&mdash; Dan Amira (@DanAmira) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanAmira/status/1796194294056829338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>

        </figure><p>“Our expectation is to win,” <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/mlb-opening-day-an-optimists-case-for-2024-yankees-and-mets.html">New York Mets</a> manager Carlos Mendoza <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/27/sports/mets-have-winning-expectations-after-2023-disappointment/">said</a> in March, at the end of spring training. The team’s new skipper projected confidence that the Mets’ retooled roster — slightly fewer stars, but still the <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/payroll/_/year/2024/sort/cap_total2">most expensive team</a> in baseball — would perform better than last year, when a highly touted squad basically <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/08/with-verlander-trade-the-new-york-mets-give-up-on-2023.html">called it quits midseason</a> just before the trade deadline. “Outside projections and things like that might say differently, but we do believe that we have a really good team,” he added. “I don’t buy the fact that expectations are low for the New York Mets in 2024.”</p><p>Unfortunately for the first-year manager, the outside projections are right so far. The Mets, despite a $326 million payroll, suck pretty bad right now. At 22-33, they are 11 games below .500 and 16 games behind the division-leading Philadelphia Phillies. Their <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/28/sports/mets-bullpen-wastes-tylor-megill-gem-in-brutal-10-inning-game-1-loss/">bullpen is a mess</a> — the previously dominant <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/edwin-diazs-injury-is-bad-familiar-news-for-the-mets.html">Edwin Diaz</a> has struggled mightily and is <a href="https://sny.tv/articles/mets-place-edwin-diaz-il-shoulder-impingement">now on the Injured List</a> — and they are a bottom-third team in the three major <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10122940-mets-biggest-red-flags-early-in-2024-season">offensive categories</a>. Perhaps worst of all, the consistent losing is causing morale to crater, as evidenced on Wednesday night. In the eighth inning of a game the Mets would lose 10-3, relief pitcher Jorge López was ejected for arguing a call. On his way to the dugout, he did something unusual.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just an overall hilarious sequence of events<br><br>Jorge Lopez allows an absolute tank to Shohei Ohtani<br><br>Then gets tossed by the THIRD BASE UMPIRE arguing a check swing that was clearly the correct call<br><br>And then he proceeds to toss his GLOVE into the stands<a href="https://t.co/BkB8C0U7AS">pic.twitter.com/BkB8C0U7AS</a></p>&mdash; Blake Harris (@BlakeHHarris) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlakeHHarris/status/1795955943823351989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>After the game, López was asked if he regretted tossing the glove. He then he said he was “the worst teammate in the whole fucking MLB.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I asked Jorge Lopez if he regretted throwing his glove into the stands. Not only did he say no, he then called the Mets “the worst team in the whole f—cking MLB.” <br><br>I later gave him a chance to clarify and he confirmed that’s what he meant.<a href="https://t.co/Io2Cqh3Bdj">pic.twitter.com/Io2Cqh3Bdj</a></p>&mdash; Steve Gelbs (@SteveGelbs) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveGelbs/status/1795980947633975642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Baseball is a game full of unwritten rules, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/the-unwritten-rules-of-baseball">some more subtle than others</a>. But throwing a glove in the stands is a pretty obvious violation. On Thursday morning, the Mets announced that López had been “designated for assignment” — <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/designate-for-assignment">meaning that</a> the 31-year-old was off the team’s 40-man roster and may end up in the minor leagues or released onto the waiver wire.</p><p>Other members of the Mets organization maintained hope after the loss. Shortstop Francisco Lindor called a players-only meeting to try to motivate each other into being less bad at baseball. “I feel like we needed to talk to look each other in the eye to say we need to get it done,” Lindor <a href="https://sny.tv/articles/mets-hold-team-meeting-after-loss-dodgers">told</a> reporters. Mets owner Steve Cohen, meanwhile — <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/nyc-casino-bid-front-runners.html">who has other big problems at Citi Field</a> — tweeted that this recent stretch was “disheartening” for the fans. “Ty for caring so much,” he wrote. Thankfully for Cohen, Mets fans have proven a high tolerance for disheartening baseball over many decades.</p><p><em>This post has been updated to reflect López’s statement after the game.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>
